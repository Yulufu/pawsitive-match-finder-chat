She is quick to love whoever she is with, gentle to take treats with a soft mouth and already knows \"sit\"! From the moment we met her she greeted us by jumping and giving us a near hug- soooooo friendly! She was enthusiastic to walk and was wiggling all over the sidewalk. She loves toys and can be so silly. She doesn't mind if you take her toy, either. Though she wants to eat every morsel of food we come across, she was not hard to walk and her tail was wagging the entire time. She showed no reactivity to dogs on leash, either. There is nothing that could shake her happiness!! What makes her unique is she was equally as happy to sit next to us while we ate lunch without any complaints. She sat beside us patiently waiting for us to be finished. She gave little tippy taps before we gave her a treat because she was so excited! Her little snorts while she sniffs sound just like a little piggy and it is so endearing. When we stopped at a coffee shop, she even took a little nap after our long walk! She would be such a good companion for a family ready to open their heart to a sweet, happy and cuddly girl. She would be excited to go on a long walk with you but also down to chill out for a movie night and cuddle up next to you. She could be great for a studio apartment or a big house with a yard. Adopt \" A Dozen Roaka Rosie, she is ready to come home with you today!!!!!!</p>",

      "summaryHtml": "Meet Almond!\r\n\r\nAlmond is a 3-year-old large mixed breed who was found as a stray in the Bronx and has since spent time in a foster home. This affectionate and playful girl is eager to find her forever home where she can be loved and cherished.\r\n\r\nMy Ideal Home\r\nAlmond would thrive in a home that provides both structure and activity. She has an energetic personality and would benefit from regular exercise, training, and positive reinforcement. She is best suited for an adult-only home or a home with older children who can respect her space and help reinforce good manners.\r\n\r\nGood with Kids?\r\nAlmond would do best in a home without young children due to her excitable nature and tendency to jump up in a social manner. Older kids who understand dog behavior may be a better fit.\r\n\r\nGood with Other Dogs?\r\nAlmond has had mixed reactions to other dogs-sometimes greeting them with a loose, wiggly body and other times barking and jumping at the fence. She would need slow, positive introductions if placed in a home with another dog.\r\n\r\nGood with Cats?\r\nUnknown-she has not been tested with cats.\r\n\r\nLeash Manners\r\nAlmond is strong on the leash and can be reactive toward dogs and small animals while walking. A front-clip harness and reward-based training will help manage this behavior.\r\n\r\nOverall Health\r\nShe has no ongoing medical concerns, though she is slightly overweight and would benefit from a balanced diet and exercise.\r\n\r\nBehavior Determination\r\nLevel 3 (Experienced Adopters Recommended) - Almond is a sweet and affectionate dog who loves attention but needs continued training for her manners, anxiety, and leash reactivity. She thrives with positive reinforcement and would do best in a structured environment.\r\n\r\nFun Fact\r\nAlmond has a reputation for being a \"kissing machine\"! If you're not careful, you'll get an unexpected smooch attack from this affectionate girl.\r\n\r\nWhat Her Friends Say\r\n\ud83d\udcac \"Almond is very sweet! She loves to play, licks a lot as a show of love, and enjoys belly rubs. She listens to commands like sit, wait, and go.\" -Her Foster\r\n\ud83d\udcac \"She was the perfect Borough Break buddy-affectionate, playful, and well-behaved on leash. She made our day and will make someone very happy!\" -Volunteer\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a fun-loving, affectionate dog who will bring energy and joy into your life, Almond could be the perfect match for you! Come meet her today! \ud83d\udc3e\r\n\r\nA staff member writes: Almond may be a little nutty (in the best way!), but her affection and loyalty are truly unmatched. Whether you're out for a stroll or just relaxing at home, Almond is always by your side, ready to share her love and bring joy to your life. If you're looking for a furry friend who's as sweet as her name and will make your world a little brighter, Almond is your girl!",

This affectionate and playful girl is eager to find her forever home where she can be loved and cherished.\r\n\r\nMy Ideal Home\r\nAlmond would thrive in a home that provides both structure and activity. She has an energetic personality and would benefit from regular exercise, training, and positive reinforcement. She is best suited for an adult-only home or a home with older children who can respect her space and help reinforce good manners.\r\n\r\nGood with Kids?\r\nAlmond would do best in a home without young children due to her excitable nature and tendency to jump up in a social manner. Older kids who understand dog behavior may be a better fit.\r\n\r\nGood with Other Dogs?\r\nAlmond has had mixed reactions to other dogs-sometimes greeting them with a loose, wiggly body and other times barking and jumping at the fence. She would need slow, positive introductions if placed in a home with another dog.\r\n\r\nGood with Cats?\r\nUnknown-she has not been tested with cats.\r\n\r\nLeash Manners\r\nAlmond is strong on the leash and can be reactive toward dogs and small animals while walking.

His microchip traced to a previous owner, but no one responded, so he's now looking for a fresh start with a family of his own.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b style=\"color:#00a7b5;\">My Ideal Home</b><br>\r\nA patient, structured home that enjoys training and enrichment. Avra is a young, bouncy guy who thrives with routine, clear cues, and positive reinforcement. Think sniffy walks, puzzle feeders, and calm decompression time.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b style=\"color:#00a7b5;\">Good with Kids?</b><br>\r\nRecommended <b>no very young children (under 5)</b> due to jumpy greetings, leash-biting when excited, and general big-dog enthusiasm. Dog-savvy older kids could be a match with guidance.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b style=\"color:#00a7b5;\">Good with Other Pets?</b><br>\r\nDog history is limited. In shelter meets he was loose/wiggly at first but became very exuberant, ignoring corrections. We recommend slow, structured introductions to a well-matched, tolerant dog, and <i>no dog parks</i> while he builds skills.<br>\r\nCats: unknown.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b style=\"color:#00a7b5;\">Leash Manners</b><br>\r\nMild puller who loves to say hi. He can get overstimulated and play-grab the leash or jump when excited. He responds to redirection with toys/food and does best with a front-clip harness, \"four on the floor,\" and reward-based training (pattern games, engage/disengage).<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b style=\"color:#00a7b5;\">Overall Health</b><br>\r\nAvra arrived with <b>allergic dermatitis/alopecia</b> that's improving on treatment (Apoquel course completed, cefpodoxime, medicated mousse). He's heartworm negative and up to date on core vaccines. He is currently <b>not neutered</b>; there's a temporary spay/neuter waiver while his skin finishes healing, and he can be neutered once medically cleared.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b style=\"color:#00a7b5;\">Behavior Determination</b><br>\r\n<b>Level 2 (no young kids)</b> - Social, wiggly, and affectionate; needs polishing on impulse control and cooperative handling while his skin is sensitive. He'll shine with consistency, decompression, and force-free training.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b style=\"color:#00a7b5;\">Other Fun Facts</b><br>\r\nTreat-motivated, offers play bows, and loves attention.<br>\r\nHe tolerated fitting a harness/shirt for skin protection and happily munched cheese during his session.<br>\r\nBig heart, bigger wiggles - Avra can't wait to be someone's goofy, loyal sidekick.\r\n\r\nA volunteer writes: I am not prepared for the wonder that is Avra when I go to fetch him for his walk. 80lbs, in a pastel hoodie, sitting on his bed looking at me. He approaches quietly with his ears back and wiggles through his body. I learned that when he arrived he was tentative about going on walks, but that is certainly no longer the case! He knows the routine and is excited to get a break from his kennel, and uses his full 80lbs to lead me outside. He doesn't yet know that he'll get time in the yard, and his happiness when we get there",

      "description": "My Boroughbreaker writes: I heard that Bababooey was fearful when he first arrived at the shelter, but he shows no sign of that now! He was SO excited to head out for the day, and thrilled to interact with anyone who came his way. He's very interested in other dogs, and wants to meet them all. He still has a lot of puppy energy (I suspect he'd be a great running companion) and could probably benefit from a little leash training, but he's so smart and I'm sure he'd learn quickly. He already sits on command and lies down when directed. He also loves food, but it VERY gentle when taking a treat from your hand. Also, if you sit down, he immediately comes up and puts his front paws and head in your lap, and will stay for the longest time if you give him skritches. He's a total sweetheart. What my friends at ACC say about me: My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet! It is unknown if I have ever lived with other animals or children. I am finding the shelter a little overwhelming, but when it's just you and me and some peace and quiet you'll see what a love bug I am. I can be slow to adjust to new environments.

This incredibly happy, adaptable dog always has a smile on her face and is ready with a \"woo woo\" of excitement for her favorite things - meals, walks, or someone coming home to snuggle her. Don't let the powdered sugar face fool you, this slightly senior girl has some LIFE to live and lots of adorably sassy opinions on how she'd like to live it (with a pillow, and under a blanket, if you please! and plenty of time to sniff on walks). She'll walk for miles on a loose leash, sniffing as she goes. She is THRILLED when a stranger calls her over for pets, throwing herself at them butt-first and nudging their hand if they stop petting too soon. She struggles with seeing other dogs, but is easily redirected if you keep an eye out for potential triggers and redirect her before she's seen them. Beyond that she is a snuggly, sassy, silly, sleeeeepy wonder dog who would love nothing more than to cuddle up and show you her perfect personality and equally perfect teefers sticking out from that underbite.\r\n\r\nMy Foster Writes:\r\nBELLA is the HAPPIEST and SWEETEST dog I have ever met. She is a manatee, snuggler and also a mermaid. If you seek a low energy and easy baby that sleeps all day and only maintenance required is love, this is your girl. I'm not sure I believe that Bella is 9YO -- she looks younger and seems too healthy, no joint or other problems. Her coat is super glossy and sleek. It breaks my heart that someone dropped her off at ACC after 9 years, and this granny deserves the happiest of her golden years. I cannot recommend her highly enough. She is a true gem. And I have worked with over hundreds of dogs in the past year, training. Bella is one of a kind. (I have never seen her break into a run, so her speeds might be sleep, rest and some walking. AND she does snore just above a whisper while I work from home -- it's very relaxing. Bella can be reactive with others dogs. She is easily redirected, has improved with me and I am confident will become less so over time.)\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet!</p>\r\n<p>I am a sweet, social, older gal, looking for the perfect forever home!</p>\r\n<p>I need a home where there are no other dogs.</p>\r\n<p>I would do best in a home without very tiny humans, although I could be open to older human children once I meet them.</p>\r\n\r\nThere is an adorable video of me on Instagram! <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DF22WY1uyFc/?igsh=bGdhcDRibWlvNXNo\">Click here to experience the cuteness!</a> <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Don't let the powdered sugar face fool you, this slightly senior girl has some LIFE to live and lots of adorably sassy opinions on how she'd like to live it (with a pillow, and under a blanket, if you please! and plenty of time to sniff on walks). She'll walk for miles on a loose leash, sniffing as she goes. She is THRILLED when a stranger calls her over for pets, throwing herself at them butt-first and nudging their hand if they stop petting too soon. She struggles with seeing other dogs, but is easily redirected if you keep an eye out for potential triggers and redirect her before she's seen them.

She is a manatee, snuggler and also a mermaid. If you seek a low energy and easy baby that sleeps all day and only maintenance required is love, this is your girl. I'm not sure I believe that Bella is 9YO -- she looks younger and seems too healthy, no joint or other problems. Her coat is super glossy and sleek. It breaks my heart that someone dropped her off at ACC after 9 years, and this granny deserves the happiest of her golden years. I cannot recommend her highly enough. She is a true gem. And I have worked with over hundreds of dogs in the past year, training. Bella is one of a kind. (I have never seen her break into a run, so her speeds might be sleep, rest and some walking.

She is very curious to smell everything and happy to see people. She can be patient wherever you go but does plop down if she's tired. She didn't bark with me at all. She listens if I say drop it or stop. She doesn't know sit yet. She got so many compliments from many people I wish I had an adopt me leash or vest for her. However, her Halloween costume was great. She did get little scared of loud noises and big cars but some pets and reassurance she's okay. She loved walking around Central Park.  She didn't like the treats the cafe gave so maybe she likes particular treats. If I could adopt her, I would.\r\n\r\nBellini arrived at MACC as a stray with no known history. During her stay in the care center she has been observed to be highly fearful and has allowed limited handling. Noted to baulk, pancake, and refuse to walk while on leash. Bellini is also noted to escalate to thrashing when feeling leash pressure. Due to the detailed behaviors we recommend an experienced adult only home. \r\n\r\nBellini is a super sweet pup. With a little time and patience for her to decompress, she will blossom.\r\nI could see her fitting into the pack of a family with kids or as a sidekick for a single person.\r\nShe doesn't have much leash manners, and can pull many directions to keep sniffing. But occasionally she would look back and she was so excited to see me and leaned in for pets. She doesn't know basic commands like sit, etc. however she seems eager to listen and is very curious.\r\nShe was not reactive on the leash when we say from afar people, dogs, wheels (scooters, skateboards, etc).\r\nShe didn't bark or growl or show any kind of aggression. No signs of pancaking during the walk. She's sooo gentle with taking snacks and playing with her toys. \r\nI gave her a bath and she was amazing. So patient and not afraid at all. She gently nibbled on fries in the tub or playing with the squeaky toy and was totally calm. She loved the toweling off and was even okay with a little bit of the blower to dry her.\r\nWe took a car ride back to the shelter. She did okay with me in the backseat of the car, but was very wriggly. I don't think she's used to riding in the car. With practice I think she'll settle down more and be comfortable.\r\nHoping once she gets into a routine, she'll settle down and build confidence.",

      "summaryHtml": "MEET BENTLEY!\r\nBentley was brought to ACC when his former family could no longer care for him. He's now looking for a fresh start with someone who understands big dogs with big feelings.\r\n\r\nMY IDEAL HOME\r\nAn experienced, adult-only home that can provide structure, patience, and positive reinforcement training. Bentley does best with a quiet environment and slow, consistent introductions. A home outside the city or with a private yard would be ideal.\r\n\r\nGOOD WITH KIDS?\r\nRecommended adult-only due to his fear-based behavior and touch sensitivity.\r\n\r\nGOOD WITH OTHER PETS?\r\nLimited history. In shelter playgroups, Bentley has been nervous and defensive around other dogs. He may be best as the only pet. Cats: unknown.\r\n\r\nLEASH MANNERS\r\nBentley can be strong on leash and alert-barks at people and dogs. He is working on leash manners with a front-clip harness, treat-based engagement, and pattern games to help him stay focused.\r\n\r\nOVERALL HEALTH\r\nBentley is a young adult, vaccinated, microchipped, and will be neutered prior to adoption. He recently recovered from a common upper respiratory infection.\r\n\r\nBEHAVIOR DETERMINATION\r\nLevel 3 - Bentley is a fearful, handling-sensitive dog who warms up with familiar handlers. He needs decompression, slow exposure to new things, and force-free training to build confidence. No children under 13.\r\n\r\nOTHER FUN FACTS\r\nBentley enjoys squeaky toys, soft blankets, and gentle attention from people he trusts. He may take time to open up, but once he does, he's affectionate and loyal. Bentley is ready to leave the shelter behind and find his person.\r\n\r\n",

He's now looking for a fresh start with someone who understands big dogs with big feelings.\r\n\r\nMY IDEAL HOME\r\nAn experienced, adult-only home that can provide structure, patience, and positive reinforcement training. Bentley does best with a quiet environment and slow, consistent introductions. A home outside the city or with a private yard would be ideal.\r\n\r\nGOOD WITH KIDS?\r\nRecommended adult-only due to his fear-based behavior and touch sensitivity.\r\n\r\nGOOD WITH OTHER PETS?\r\nLimited history. In shelter playgroups, Bentley has been nervous and defensive around other dogs. He may be best as the only pet. Cats: unknown.\r\n\r\nLEASH MANNERS\r\nBentley can be strong on leash and alert-barks at people and dogs. He is working on leash manners with a front-clip harness, treat-based engagement, and pattern games to help him stay focused.\r\n\r\nOVERALL HEALTH\r\nBentley is a young adult, vaccinated, microchipped, and will be neutered prior to adoption. He recently recovered from a common upper respiratory infection.\r\n\r\nBEHAVIOR DETERMINATION\r\nLevel 3 - Bentley is a fearful, handling-sensitive dog who warms up with familiar handlers. He needs decompression, slow exposure to new things, and force-free training to build confidence. No children under 13.\r\n\r\nOTHER FUN FACTS\r\nBentley enjoys squeaky toys, soft blankets, and gentle attention from people he trusts. He may take time to open up, but once he does, he's affectionate and loyal. Bentley is ready to leave the shelter behind and find his person.\r\n\r\n",

His previous owner described him as a friendly and outgoing; also very high energy.  During his stay, Blue Baloo has been social and treat motivated with staff.  Recently however, he is showing concerning poor impulse control and signs of social hyperarousal.  Blue Baloo as been observed to persistently jump on handlers and at times pushes off staff with his front paws.  This is most prevalent during walks.  While he is treat motivated, he is not consistently able to be redirected.  We recommend placement with an experienced New Hope Partner that can help manage his behavior with positive, force free handling.  \r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>I would do best in a home without very tiny humans, although I could be open to older human children once I meet them.</p>\r\n<p>I am playful and cute!</p>\r\n\r\nMy boroughbreaker writes:Blue was super interested in the lakes and seems like he likes to swim. He also absolutely loved fetch and chewing the ball after. It seems like he would love chew toys. He was such a sweetheart and was so social and so full of love. Blue was also amazing with snacks he never snatched them and always waited for them to be given and took them out of my hand so gently. He's very strong but wasn't lunging he just liked to move fast and was very interested in squirrels. He was occasionally interested in other dogs in a playful way. Blue also had tons of energy and even after walking for hours he was happy to run / walk more. Also I didn't check the box for I listen to commands because I didn't try any but he responds to his name well and sat for treats every time. He also did great on stairs. Blue will truly brighten someone's home and life.\r\n\r\nA Volunteer Wrote: This might make you cry, but you don't have time because you need to RUN to adopt this dog who has lived with cats, dogs, and kids: When asked about Baloo, his previous owner said, \"I love him with my whole soul and am so glad I got to be his owner, even if it wasn't forever.\" We are honoring them both while Baloo is at the shelter by showering this playful, friendly baby with love, and it is the lightest lift given that he is the giver of endless kisses and tail wags, especially when belly rubs are involved. We would be so thrilled if you would take over as his new devoted owner, this time forever!\r\n",

She's a 56-pound bundle of bounces, wiggles, and affectionate energy who's been patiently waiting for someone to see past the shelter stress and into her goofy, lovable soul. Found as a stray and now fully vetted and spayed, Blues Clues is ready to put her detective skills to good use sniffing out snacks, toys, and a forever home.\r\n\r\nMy foster writes: Looking for a cuddly and low-key dog- Blues Clue is for you! This 6 year old gem is the perfect lady, respectful at home and happy to doze away on the couch or in a pile of pillows- even better if she has a blanket to keep her cozy! As an adult, she is relatively low energy and content with 2 easy walks and maybe some fun toy play but that's about it! With that routine, she has shown to be fully house-trained which is a great skill to have in an apartment. She does show some reactivity to dogs and some wheeled items but is super food motivated. Since we have had her, she will easily let dogs walk by her with the reward of a nice piece of chicken so the behavior is very easy to manage even during busy times of day. We have loved having her in our home and know she will make a wonderful pet for anyone who is looking for a easy-going companion!\r\n\r\nMy foster writes: Meet Blue's Clues - the strong diva with the cutest puppy dog eyes you've ever seen!\r\nShe spends her days trying to collect cuddles from every single person she walks past, clearly a lover girl at heart. Blue's Clues is great with humans and has amazing intuition. She really gets you and understands what you're telling her, which makes her a total joy to have around.\r\nPlaytime is a non-negotiable in her world. Toss the toy once, and you've just signed up for a lifetime of fetch, she'll never let you forget how much fun it is!\r\nShe's respectful of boundaries and knows the rules. In our apartment, she understands she's only allowed on one bed, and she sticks to it, no couch surfing or room sneaking here!\r\nBlue's Clues is ready for her forever home, with just one simple requirement: a safe, loving space and at least one bed (or couch!) she can call her own. Are you ready to fall in love?\r\n\r\nMy foster writes: Blue is the best friend you've been looking for. She'll cuddle you when you're down, protect you and keep you company. She'd thrive in a one dog household. She loves going for walks and playing with her toys. You don't have to worry about blue being home alone- she is very respectful of her humans stuff. She's house trained and will let you know if she has to go outside. She's also good with children.",

She's a 56-pound bundle of bounces, wiggles, and affectionate energy who's been patiently waiting for someone to see past the shelter stress and into her goofy, lovable soul. Found as a stray and now fully vetted and spayed, Blues Clues is ready to put her detective skills to good use sniffing out snacks, toys, and a forever home.\r\n\r\nMy foster writes: Looking for a cuddly and low-key dog- Blues Clue is for you! This 6 year old gem is the perfect lady, respectful at home and happy to doze away on the couch or in a pile of pillows- even better if she has a blanket to keep her cozy! As an adult, she is relatively low energy and content with 2 easy walks and maybe some fun toy play but that's about it! With that routine, she has shown to be fully house-trained which is a great skill to have in an apartment. She does show some reactivity to dogs and some wheeled items but is super food motivated. Since we have had her, she will easily let dogs walk by her with the reward of a nice piece of chicken so the behavior is very easy to manage even during busy times of day. We have loved having her in our home and know she will make a wonderful pet for anyone who is looking for a easy-going companion!\r\n\r\nMy foster writes: Meet Blue's Clues - the strong diva with the cutest puppy dog eyes you've ever seen!\r\nShe spends her days trying to collect cuddles from every single person she walks past, clearly a lover girl at heart. Blue's Clues is great with humans and has amazing intuition. She really gets you and understands what you're telling her, which makes her a total joy to have around.\r\nPlaytime is a non-negotiable in her world. Toss the toy once, and you've just signed up for a lifetime of fetch, she'll never let you forget how much fun it is!\r\nShe's respectful of boundaries and knows the rules. In our apartment, she understands she's only allowed on one bed, and she sticks to it, no couch surfing or room sneaking here!\r\nBlue's Clues is ready for her forever home, with just one simple requirement: a safe, loving space and at least one bed (or couch!) she can call her own. Are you ready to fall in love?\r\n\r\nMy foster writes: Blue is the best friend you've been looking for. She'll cuddle you when you're down, protect you and keep you company. She'd thrive in a one dog household. She loves going for walks and playing with her toys. You don't have to worry about blue being home alone- she is very respectful of her humans stuff. She's house trained and will let you know if she has to go outside. She's also good with children.",

Low energy and laid-back, Brock is the perfect Netflix-and-snack companion (especially if treats are involved-he lives for those). He's a good boy who listens well and loves long walks when it's time to stretch those legs.\r\n\r\nAnother foster writes:\r\nBrock is the mush ball of your dreams! This easy-going older gentleman loves naps, cuddles, and treats of all kinds. He's happiest when he's near his people, getting butt scratches and belly rubs. He naps like a champ but can be left alone to do his own thing. This hungry, hungry hippo will do anything for a treat, but has good table manners for a food-motivated good boy. He's a dream on the leash, walking next to you with ease as he explores the neighborhood. Brock's charm is obvious to everyone on the street - he gets constant compliments when he's out. He loves nothing more than cuddling on the couch with you at the end of the day. This sweet angel is a big boy with an even bigger heart and would love to nuzzle you to the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnother foster writes:\r\nBrock is the sweetest older gentleman who just wants to hang out and be near his people. He's super sweet, super chill, and the perfect buddy for lazy days, short walks, and snack breaks. He's also a really good listener, knowing tons of commands like sit, stay, and lay down, and he's currently learning \"up\" and \"drop it\" like a total pro. Brock has great leash manners, does fine on his own when you're out, and melts hearts everywhere he goes with his big head and soft eyes. He's not needy, just happy to be nearby, whether you're watching TV, working from home, or just relaxing. If you're looking for a low-key, lovable sidekick who's all about comfort, cuddles, and good company, Brock's your guy!",

He's a dream on the leash, walking next to you with ease as he explores the neighborhood. Brock's charm is obvious to everyone on the street - he gets constant compliments when he's out. He loves nothing more than cuddling on the couch with you at the end of the day. This sweet angel is a big boy with an even bigger heart and would love to nuzzle you to the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnother foster writes:\r\nBrock is the sweetest older gentleman who just wants to hang out and be near his people. He's super sweet, super chill, and the perfect buddy for lazy days, short walks, and snack breaks. He's also a really good listener, knowing tons of commands like sit, stay, and lay down, and he's currently learning \"up\" and \"drop it\" like a total pro. Brock has great leash manners, does fine on his own when you're out, and melts hearts everywhere he goes with his big head and soft eyes. He's not needy, just happy to be nearby, whether you're watching TV, working from home, or just relaxing.

His weight is listed at 50 pounds but he is much more of a lap sized guy - which he proves easily in the yard. He quickly dons his PJS and makes his way onto my lap, not really willing to get off of it, preferring cuddles to the rainy grass. He was initially found as a stray tied up in lower Manhattan. He was adopted but returned when the family did not think he was a good fit.\r\nUnsurprisingly based on his initial shyness, Bull has been spooked by children and large crowds. Bull has preferred to keep space from other dogs. He enjoys car rides, long walks and baths! Ask to meet him today! ",

Look no further, because Cedar is here to steal your heart and fill your days with endless joy! This lovable companion is eagerly waiting to find her forever home, and she's bound to be the perfect addition to any family.\r\n\r\nCedar's incredible demeanor makes her an ideal companion for all your daily adventures. Housebroken and well-mannered, she understands the rules and won't jump up on furniture, ensuring a seamless transition into your home. Her favorite game is a spirited game of tug, and you'll find immense joy in sharing these playful moments with her.\r\n\r\nCedar's crate training adds an extra layer of convenience to her adaptable nature. Whether you're working from home or heading out for errands, she's content and secure in her crate. And speaking of working from home, Cedar is the ultimate coworker. She's more than happy to snooze by your feet as you work, providing both companionship and comfort.\r\n\r\nStrolls around the neighborhood are a true delight with Cedar by your side. She approaches walks with a leisurely pace, savoring every moment and taking in all the captivating scents along the way. Her curiosity and appreciation for the world around her are a constant reminder to find joy in life's simple pleasures.\r\nCedar's endearing qualities have won the hearts of everyone she meets, making her a favorite among shelter volunteers. Her unwavering spirit and genuine affection make her an exceptional companion that's ready to fill your life with happiness.\r\n\r\nDon't miss your chance to adopt Cedar and make her a cherished member of your family. Her playful antics, loving nature, and heartwarming presence are sure to bring a smile to your face every day.\r\n\r\nCedar is the ultimate couch potato and professional snuggler. She could spend the whole day curled up next to you while you catch up on your favorite shows or get lost in a good book. She's a total homebody-happy with a couple of short walks, a game of tug, and plenty of treats. She's also housebroken and, despite being a bit of a big girl, does just fine in smaller spaces as long as she's with her people.\r\n\r\nCedar is super low-maintenance and totally okay being left alone, so you won't have to worry about coming home to a disaster. Instead, you'll be greeted by a happy pup who's just excited you're back.\r\nShe's incredibly loving once she knows you, but she can be a little shy with new people. She needs slow introductions and a little patience, but once she trusts you, she's all in. Cedar tends to feel more comfortable around female-presenting folks, though she has made a few exceptions, usually for people with lots of love (and treats) to offer. ",

He can't wait to snuggle up and pass out on your lap after a good kissing and licking session! He loves people and is easy to be around. Very well mannered and easy going guy. He can work on being around other dogs and after he's found his forever home his anxiety will likely subside as well. He's a one of a kind dog overall!\r\n\r\nMy foster writes: \r\nChamp is, well, a Champion of many things. But above all - he is a champion cuddler. A crowned cuddle king, who will literally leave a bowl of food behind if it means he has a chance to snuggle next to you and get a belly rub. He loves so deeply and unrelentingly, even shortly after you meet him - he'll gaze at you with soulful eyes and lick your face if you let him. Champ seizes any chance to love and be loved by his human. He's like a heated and weighted blanket combo, ready to comfort you. Champ has a huge heart that matches his huge head. He's smarty (of course his head is so big, it holds his smarts!) - he picks up on training cues quickly, whether working on his tolerance for being left alone (can you fault a shelter dog for wanting to be by your side?) or teaching him to \"check in\" with you on a walk (say \"look at me Champ!\" And he'll glance back with a big goofy smile). He's learning leash manners with positive reinforcement and clicker/treat training. When he hears the click and gets it right, he stamps excitedly and smiles, awaiting his \"good boy!\" Followed by a treat. This Champ doesn't need a cheerleader but if you want to see him do his stamp, wide-smile victory dance, definitely cheer for him! He seems to trust humans more readily than other dogs, but with the right dog and slow introduction, Champ might also love a canine friend - but he's fully content just being with his human. He sleeps through the night, even when he's not next to you. But I'm sure he'd prefer to be by your side. He's also a great ride-along boy, hanging (and sometimes sleeping) quietly in the backseat with his seat belt buckled. Potty trained and not destructive when left alone, Champ is a solidly wonderful boy whose love and devotion are so unrelenting, you'll wonder how you ever got so lucky to be his friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nDogs with Level 2 determinations are believed to be suitable for adopters with some previous dog experience. They will have displayed behavior in the shelter (or have owner-reported behavior) that requires some training, behavior management or modification. Dogs with a Level 2 determination may have multiple potential challenges and these may be presenting at differing levels of intensity, so careful consideration ",

He can't wait to snuggle up and pass out on your lap after a good kissing and licking session! He loves people and is easy to be around. Very well mannered and easy going guy. He can work on being around other dogs and after he's found his forever home his anxiety will likely subside as well. He's a one of a kind dog overall!\r\n\r\nMy foster writes: \r\nChamp is, well, a Champion of many things. But above all - he is a champion cuddler. A crowned cuddle king, who will literally leave a bowl of food behind if it means he has a chance to snuggle next to you and get a belly rub. He loves so deeply and unrelentingly, even shortly after you meet him - he'll gaze at you with soulful eyes and lick your face if you let him. Champ seizes any chance to love and be loved by his human. He's like a heated and weighted blanket combo, ready to comfort you. Champ has a huge heart that matches his huge head. He's smarty (of course his head is so big, it holds his smarts!) - he picks up on training cues quickly, whether working on his tolerance for being left alone (can you fault a shelter dog for wanting to be by your side?) or teaching him to \"check in\" with you on a walk (say \"look at me Champ!\" And he'll glance back with a big goofy smile). He's learning leash manners with positive reinforcement and clicker/treat training. When he hears the click and gets it right, he stamps excitedly and smiles, awaiting his \"good boy!\" Followed by a treat. This Champ doesn't need a cheerleader but if you want to see him do his stamp, wide-smile victory dance, definitely cheer for him! He seems to trust humans more readily than other dogs, but with the right dog and slow introduction, Champ might also love a canine friend - but he's fully content just being with his human. He sleeps through the night, even when he's not next to you. But I'm sure he'd prefer to be by your side. He's also a great ride-along boy, hanging (and sometimes sleeping) quietly in the backseat with his seat belt buckled. Potty trained and not destructive when left alone, Champ is a solidly wonderful boy whose love and devotion are so unrelenting, you'll wonder how you ever got so lucky to be his friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nDogs with Level 2 determinations are believed to be suitable for adopters with some previous dog experience. They will have displayed behavior in the shelter (or have owner-reported behavior) that requires some training, behavior management or modification. Dogs with a Level 2 determination may have multiple potential challenges and these may be presenting at differing levels of intensity, so careful consideration ",

He's a total lovebug who wants nothing more than to be by your side-especially if you're handing out chest rubs. Taking a break from work? Great, he's already there, giving you those big eyes that say, \"Is it cuddle o'clock yet?\"\r\nHe's a pro on the leash (with the occasional detour when an interesting smell crosses his path), but overall, he's got that walk game down.\r\nPlop yourself on the floor, and Choco Pie will politely trot over and sit like a gentleman, just close enough to make sure you notice how soft his head and chest are. Within seconds, all decorum vanishes-flop!-he's on his back, legs in the air, inviting you to pets on his chest, sides, squishy neck folds, and under his chin. Also, you will definitely want to.\r\nHe's brave and confident when you're around, but being alone still makes him a little anxious. He's working on it, though, and with some patience and gentle training, he'll learn to be more confident and independent.\r\nIf you're looking for a loyal shadow with a heart as soft as a marshmallow center, Choco Pie is your perfect treat.\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy Writes: Chocolate was very chill from the start, met us begging for belly rubs and happily walked over to the park. We walked some trails then stopped under a shady tree - chocolate loved lounging with us even more than walking!",

      "summaryHtml": "Meet Colby!\r\nOwner surrender (his former family-an older couple-couldn't keep up with his very high energy). Previously arrived via police after an eviction case, and was adopted before being returned for mouthiness and activity needs.\r\n\r\nMy Ideal Home\r\nActive, experienced, adult-only home that enjoys training and daily exercise. Think: long, structured walks, decompression time, and plenty of enrichment (sniffy outings, food puzzles, tug with rules, flirt pole). Consistency + positive reinforcement will help him channel his enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nGood with Kids?\r\nRecommended adult-only (no children under 13) per behavior team.\r\n\r\nGood with Other Pets?\r\nHistory suggests he can be playful with some dogs, but shelter notes show over-arousal/kennel reactivity and tense gate greets. No dog parks. If you have a resident dog, plan slow, structured introductions (parallel walks, breaks, supervision). Cats: unknown.\r\n\r\nLeash Manners\r\nStrong, eager walker who pulls hard at times; a front-clip harness or head halter plus reward-based loose-leash practice is recommended. He may react to small animals and fast movers (squirrels, birds, bikes, skateboards)-build focus with \"let's go\" and treat-and-retreat games.\r\n\r\nOverall Health\r\nNeutered, approximately 50 lbs. Vet intake: apparently healthy. Housebroken per previous owner. As with any newly adopted dog, your vet can personalize his wellness plan.\r\n\r\nBehavior Determination & Other\r\nACC Behavior Level: 3\r\nPotential challenges noted: mouthiness/rough treat-taking, jumping up, strength/leash pulling, resource guarding of high-value or \"found\" objects, handling sensitivity when over-aroused, on-leash reactivity to small animals/moving objects, and stress in/around crates or close quarters with other dogs.\r\nRecommendations: adult-only home, no dog parks, use management (front-clip harness, baby gates, tethered settle), trade-up for any item in his mouth (never grab), and practice default cues (\"sit,\" \"off,\" \"find it\") to build impulse control.\r\n\r\nFun Facts\r\nVolunteers call him \"easy-going, happy, WONDERFUL\" with joyful prancing and a stellar sit for treats. He loves park sniffs, sunbathing at your feet, and-best of all-being part of the action with his people.\r\n\r\nIf you're up for training and tons of fun with a smart, athletic sidekick, Colby is ready to be your adventure buddy!\r\n\r\nMy boroughbreaker writes: We took a walk around Central Park and did a little sunbathing at the conservatory! He has a lot of energy and is super eager to sniff everything he can. The bustle of the city street was a little overstimulating for him, but once we got to sit down away from cars, runners, and bikes, he was very chill and started looking for pets, snuggles, and kisses. He really loved getting some time in the grass and leaves. Once you've established some trust, he happily responds to sit, paw, and lie down (for treats).",

Previously arrived via police after an eviction case, and was adopted before being returned for mouthiness and activity needs.\r\n\r\nMy Ideal Home\r\nActive, experienced, adult-only home that enjoys training and daily exercise. Think: long, structured walks, decompression time, and plenty of enrichment (sniffy outings, food puzzles, tug with rules, flirt pole). Consistency + positive reinforcement will help him channel his enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nGood with Kids?\r\nRecommended adult-only (no children under 13) per behavior team.\r\n\r\nGood with Other Pets?\r\nHistory suggests he can be playful with some dogs, but shelter notes show over-arousal/kennel reactivity and tense gate greets. No dog parks. If you have a resident dog, plan slow, structured introductions (parallel walks, breaks, supervision). Cats: unknown.\r\n\r\nLeash Manners\r\nStrong, eager walker who pulls hard at times; a front-clip harness or head halter plus reward-based loose-leash practice is recommended. He may react to small animals and fast movers (squirrels, birds, bikes, skateboards)-build focus with \"let's go\" and treat-and-retreat games.\r\n\r\nOverall Health\r\nNeutered, approximately 50 lbs. Vet intake: apparently healthy. Housebroken per previous owner. As with any newly adopted dog, your vet can personalize his wellness plan.\r\n\r\nBehavior Determination & Other\r\nACC Behavior Level: 3\r\nPotential challenges noted: mouthiness/rough treat-taking, jumping up, strength/leash pulling, resource guarding of high-value or \"found\" objects, handling sensitivity when over-aroused, on-leash reactivity to small animals/moving objects, and stress in/around crates or close quarters with other dogs.\r\nRecommendations: adult-only home, no dog parks, use management (front-clip harness, baby gates, tethered settle), trade-up for any item in his mouth (never grab), and practice default cues (\"sit,\" \"off,\" \"find it\") to build impulse control.\r\n\r\nFun Facts\r\nVolunteers call him \"easy-going, happy, WONDERFUL\" with joyful prancing and a stellar sit for treats. He loves park sniffs, sunbathing at your feet, and-best of all-being part of the action with his people.\r\n\r\nIf you're up for training and tons of fun with a smart, athletic sidekick, Colby is ready to be your adventure buddy!\r\n\r\nMy boroughbreaker writes: We took a walk around Central Park and did a little sunbathing at the conservatory! He has a lot of energy and is super eager to sniff everything he can. The bustle of the city street was a little overstimulating for him, but once we got to sit down away from cars, runners, and bikes, he was very chill and started looking for pets, snuggles, and kisses. He really loved getting some time in the grass and leaves. Once you've established some trust, he happily responds to sit, paw, and lie down (for treats).",

She came to ACC after getting glowing reviews from her previous home, one that included multiple adults, children and other dogs. She has also done well when subsequently being introduced to cats in a foster setting.\r\n\r\nShe wants to know what you're thinking and will cutely tilt her head when you speak. And she will attentively play with various toys, while also listening to commands like \"sit\", \"paw\" and \"down\". She will let you know when she wants to receive some affection with gentle pawing or resting her head nearby or on your knee.\r\n\r\nOn walks, she can be excitable on leash when passing larger dogs within tight settings because of her loyalty, but the rest of the time she's as docile as can be. She is excellent in the open space of the dog park, and even comes to the defense of other dogs when they are being bullied. While she has high energy when outside, she is very relaxed inside the home.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a jogging companion, Dakota is happy to run alongside you. You can see in her profile she enjoys running along the water and even on NYC bridges. She also is great in a car and loves a good hiking experience for outdoor recreation.\r\n\r\nDakota is super cute and happy to get dressed up in various outfits. She is a big fan of the Giants, Yankees, Knicks and Rangers, and she doesn't hate the Jets and Mets. She's allegiant but would be open to adopting a new team. She's also happy to wear festive holiday attire. Even without the outfits, she gets lots of compliments while on walks just for being who she is.\r\n\r\nShe may take a small amount of time to warm up to new people, but once she does, she will love you forever. While she was living with children in her previous home, she has yet to be introduced to children in a household setting since being fostered.\r\n\r\nShe of course loves to be pet and encouraged, but Dakota also really enjoys a \"spa day\" in the bathtub and getting belly rubs. And she appreciates her beauty sleep (and it's been working!). On a typical day, Dakota will sleep in until being woken up, sometimes even late into the morning. She is typically curled up on the couch and happy to be pet as she is waking up. Then she is patient as her caretaker is getting ready themselves while waiting to be given breakfast and go out for her first walk.\r\n\r\nDakota is truly ready to breathe life into a fresh home and can't wait to be a great addition to her new family!

While she was living with children in her previous home, she has yet to be introduced to children in a household setting since being fostered.\r\n\r\nShe of course loves to be pet and encouraged, but Dakota also really enjoys a \"spa day\" in the bathtub and getting belly rubs. And she appreciates her beauty sleep (and it's been working!). On a typical day, Dakota will sleep in until being woken up, sometimes even late into the morning. She is typically curled up on the couch and happy to be pet as she is waking up. Then she is patient as her caretaker is getting ready themselves while waiting to be given breakfast and go out for her first walk.\r\n\r\nDakota is truly ready to breathe life into a fresh home and can't wait to be a great addition to her new family!

      "description": "My foster writes:\r\n\r\nAffectionate, curious and caring, Dakota has it all.\r\n\r\nFully housetrained, Dakota can be left alone for several hours on her own without any risk of incident.\r\n\r\nDakota loves everyone. She came to ACC after getting glowing reviews from her previous home, one that included multiple adults, children and other dogs. She has also done well when subsequently being introduced to cats in a foster setting.\r\n\r\nShe wants to know what you're thinking and will cutely tilt her head when you speak. And she will attentively play with various toys, while also listening to commands like \"sit\", \"paw\" and \"down\". She will let you know when she wants to receive some affection with gentle pawing or resting her head nearby or on your knee.\r\n\r\nOn walks, she can be excitable on leash when passing larger dogs within tight settings because of her loyalty, but the rest of the time she's as docile as can be. She is excellent in the open space of the dog park, and even comes to the defense of other dogs when they are being bullied. While she has high energy when outside, she is very relaxed inside the home.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a jogging companion, Dakota is happy to run alongside you. You can see in her profile she enjoys running along the water and even on NYC bridges. She also is great in a car and loves a good hiking experience for outdoor recreation.\r\n\r\nDakota is super cute and happy to get dressed up in various outfits. She is a big fan of the Giants, Yankees, Knicks and Rangers, and she doesn't hate the Jets and Mets. She's allegiant but would be open to adopting a new team. She's also happy to wear festive holiday attire. Even without the outfits, she gets lots of compliments while on walks just for being who she is.\r\n\r\nShe may take a small amount of time to warm up to new people, but once she does, she will love you forever.

      "summaryHtml": "My foster writes: Deva is a sweet, gentle, and incredibly friendly dog who has settled into foster life beautifully. In just a week, she has shown us how easygoing, affectionate, and people-loving she is. She's fully house-trained and very calm inside the home.\r\nDeva gets along wonderfully with everyone she meets - she loves strangers and quickly becomes the center of attention wherever she goes. We haven't introduced her to children yet, but based on her overall temperament, we expect she'd do just fine.\r\nOutside, Deva is a dream to walk. She may start out a bit excited, but she quickly relaxes and strolls beside you on a loose leash. She enjoys sniffing around but listens well when her name is called. She's also been non-reactive to wildlife and small animals - even when she spotted deer upstate, she simply watched them quietly without barking. She knows \"sit\" and \"paw,\" and we suspect she'll pick up new cues easily.\r\nAt home, Deva is comfortable being left alone for a few hours. She settles quickly in her crate, usually curling up and falling asleep. If there's a lickmat in her cage - that's a real treat for her! She's a very quiet dog and rarely barks or vocalizes.\r\nDeva would fit into almost any home. She loves attention and affection but isn't needy or overly energetic. She's content with a few walks a day, some play time with her toys and plenty of cozy downtime. She has some mild skin allergies that cause her to occasionally lick or nibble her paws, but otherwise she's very easy to care for.\r\nShe also has the cutest quirks - one floppy ear that gets constant compliments, a little strut when she walks, and big soulful eyes that will absolutely melt your heart.\r\nDeva is a gentle, loving, and low-maintenance dog who is ready to bring joy and warmth to her forever family.\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet!</p>\r\n<p>I am a sweet, social, older gal, looking for the perfect forever home!</p>\r\n<p>I am finding the shelter a bit overwhelming. Outside one-on-one I am a great big cuddle bug.</p>\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy writes:\r\nThis was my first time ever doing a borough break, and Deva couldn't have been more perfect for it. She was such a good and well-behaved girl. Like any dog who's been in the shelter, she was naturally curious about the outside world, but she handled everything calmly and beautifully.\r\n\r\nWhile we were out, it was inevitable that we'd pass by other dogs, but Deva did amazing. She never pulled on the leash, and whenever we approached another dog, we both paused and kept our distance. She would look up at me and mirror my behavior, and once I gave her the okay to continue walking, she happily picked up our stroll again.\r\n\r\nShe's an incredibly sweet dog who loves her head scratches, and anyone who adopts her will truly be such a lucky owner. Spending time with her was a joy, and I'm grateful I got to share the afternoon with her. ",

In just a week, she has shown us how easygoing, affectionate, and people-loving she is. She's fully house-trained and very calm inside the home.\r\nDeva gets along wonderfully with everyone she meets - she loves strangers and quickly becomes the center of attention wherever she goes. We haven't introduced her to children yet, but based on her overall temperament, we expect she'd do just fine.\r\nOutside, Deva is a dream to walk. She may start out a bit excited, but she quickly relaxes and strolls beside you on a loose leash. She enjoys sniffing around but listens well when her name is called. She's also been non-reactive to wildlife and small animals - even when she spotted deer upstate, she simply watched them quietly without barking. She knows \"sit\" and \"paw,\" and we suspect she'll pick up new cues easily.\r\nAt home, Deva is comfortable being left alone for a few hours. She settles quickly in her crate, usually curling up and falling asleep. If there's a lickmat in her cage - that's a real treat for her! She's a very quiet dog and rarely barks or vocalizes.\r\nDeva would fit into almost any home. She loves attention and affection but isn't needy or overly energetic. She's content with a few walks a day, some play time with her toys and plenty of cozy downtime. She has some mild skin allergies that cause her to occasionally lick or nibble her paws, but otherwise she's very easy to care for.\r\nShe also has the cutest quirks - one floppy ear that gets constant compliments, a little strut when she walks, and big soulful eyes that will absolutely melt your heart.\r\nDeva is a gentle, loving, and low-maintenance dog who is ready to bring joy and warmth to her forever family.\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet!</p>\r\n<p>I am a sweet, social, older gal, looking for the perfect forever home!</p>\r\n<p>I am finding the shelter a bit overwhelming. Outside one-on-one I am a great big cuddle bug.</p>\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy writes:\r\nThis was my first time ever doing a borough break, and Deva couldn't have been more perfect for it. She was such a good and well-behaved girl. Like any dog who's been in the shelter, she was naturally curious about the outside world, but she handled everything calmly and beautifully.\r\n\r\nWhile we were out, it was inevitable that we'd pass by other dogs, but Deva did amazing. She never pulled on the leash, and whenever we approached another dog, we both paused and kept our distance. She would look up at me and mirror my behavior, and once I gave her the okay to continue walking, she happily picked up our stroll again.\r\n\r\nShe's an incredibly sweet dog who loves her head scratches, and anyone who adopts her will truly be such a lucky owner. Spending time with her was a joy, and I'm grateful I got to share the afternoon with her. ",

She's taking being back here in remarkable stride, always happy to see the staff and volunteers and so eager to accept our displays of affection, which we lavish on his loving, gentle girl. But there's only so much that can be done in a loud, overcrowded shelter, and this remarkable soul has so earned a home to call her own for the rest of her life! ",

      "summaryHtml": "My foster writes: Echo is a super sweet dog that just wants to cuddle. He loves to play and will try to involve you if he can. He is smart and well-mannered once he knows the expectations. He loves squirrels, birds, and will actually drop the ball for fetch. When Echo is in your life, he will be YOUR dog. He wants to protect you more than he wants to protect himself. He would likely do decently well at a dog park as he loves to run around/run with the pack. Anyone would be lucky to have Echo.\r\n\r\nMy other foster writes:\r\nMeet this handsome boy who will steal your heart! Echo is an affectionate sweetheart who loves nothing more than following you around for pets, nudging you for attention, and laying by your side just to be near you. He's a great listener who follows directions beautifully - he knows, off, no, stop, quiet, sit, come, and responds to his name. His leash manners continue to improve tremendously.\r\nThis playful pup has endless positive energy for tug of war and fetch, greeting you with the world's most enthusiastic tail wags and biggest smiles. Strangers constantly stop to compliment how gorgeous he is! He's the most excited dog in the world when you come home, expressing pure joy and abundant affection for the people he loves.\r\nLooking for an active companion who will shower you with love and keep you smiling? Echo is your guy!\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet!</p>\r\n<p>It is unknown if I have ever lived with other animals or children.</p>\r\n<p>I would do best in a home with only adult humans.</p>\r\n<p>I'm sensitive and shy. I'll need extra help from you.</p>\r\n<p>I prefer to call the shots and enjoy coming to you when I'm ready for pets.</p>\r\nA Volunteer Wrote: One volunteer sums this wonderful boy up as \"magic.\" He's the best company on a stroll or hanging in the back, playing with fallen leaves, sharing treats, and sneaking in as many cuddles as possible. The person who found Echo as a stray says he is very well behaved and very well trained, and we couldn't agree more! He doesn't care about other dogs on the street, appears housetrained, and walks like a pro on the leash, He has stolen all of our hearts, including that of one staff member who would like to add that Echo loves bird watching. You know what he'd love most of all? To go home with you! ",

I am a 4 year old mixed breed dog and my history is a mystery. I am a loving and caring dog who enjoys learnimg new things, being in the company of others and exploring new places while out on walks. I enjoy eating frozen treats mostly frozen sugar free applesauce, peanut butter and sunflower butter. I also like to have lap time while I watch TV, and letting to audio. I like to play with my toys alone but. im learning how to share. What I REALLY LOVE is Zoomy time!!!!! I get along well with teenagers and adults who have a lot of patience. Once I'm use to you I enjoy tummy rubs and scratches behind my ear.\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet!</p>\r\n<p>I have medical needs that staff will address with you when you meet me.</p>\r\n<p>I would appreciate slow introductions to new people and places to help me feel safe.</p>\r\n<p>I would do best in a home without very tiny humans, although I could be open to older human children once I meet them.</p>\r\n<p>I love to be loved, but on my own terms!

You could tell he wanted nothing more than to sprint and play, but his pulling became very strong, so we stuck to pavement.\r\nFoxtrot pulled moderately for our first hour but gradually started to lose steam and walk loose leash. Foxtrot does not appear to be treat motivated (although it may just be he didn't like the treats I was offering), so I couldn't keep him focused on me purely by using treats.\r\nFoxtrot was well mannered when passing dogs of all sizes and didn't show interest in squirrels or small birds, although he was somewhat curious about geese.\r\nWhile he didn't react to loud noises on the street, Foxtrot did get nervous when a larger dog started barking in his direction. At the time, we were sitting on a park bench, and he hugged my legs and trembled until the dog passed. We then resumed our walk, and he didn't display any more fear reactions.\r\nFoxtrot is a beautiful and sensitive dog who will seek the comfort and support of his owner. If you are a patient owner who can provide him with consistent physical and mental exercise and have the patience to work on his resource guarding, you are going to get a loving and loyal dog in return!\r\n\r\nA Volunteer Wrote: \"Prepare yourself for unbearable cuteness,\" warned the video of Foxtrot that was sent to me before I met him. Even so, there is no preparing for this cutest, waggiest boy! Foxtrot, who has previously\u00a0lived with a child, has shown his playful side to everyone at the shelter, including other dogs. His precious owner said Foxtrot's\u00a0only\u00a0sad when he's left alone, but this is so a dog worth sticking around for! Please, won't you come and be his forever buddy?",

You could tell he wanted nothing more than to sprint and play, but his pulling became very strong, so we stuck to pavement.\r\nFoxtrot pulled moderately for our first hour but gradually started to lose steam and walk loose leash. Foxtrot does not appear to be treat motivated (although it may just be he didn't like the treats I was offering), so I couldn't keep him focused on me purely by using treats.\r\nFoxtrot was well mannered when passing dogs of all sizes and didn't show interest in squirrels or small birds, although he was somewhat curious about geese.\r\nWhile he didn't react to loud noises on the street, Foxtrot did get nervous when a larger dog started barking in his direction. At the time, we were sitting on a park bench, and he hugged my legs and trembled until the dog passed. We then resumed our walk, and he didn't display any more fear reactions.\r\nFoxtrot is a beautiful and sensitive dog who will seek the comfort and support of his owner. If you are a patient owner who can provide him with consistent physical and mental exercise and have the patience to work on his resource guarding, you are going to get a loving and loyal dog in return!\r\n\r\nA Volunteer Wrote: \"Prepare yourself for unbearable cuteness,\" warned the video of Foxtrot that was sent to me before I met him. Even so, there is no preparing for this cutest, waggiest boy! Foxtrot, who has previously\u00a0lived with a child, has shown his playful side to everyone at the shelter, including other dogs. His precious owner said Foxtrot's\u00a0only\u00a0sad when he's left alone, but this is so a dog worth sticking around for! Please, won't you come and be his forever buddy?",

I would appreciate slow introductions to new people and places to help me feel safe. I need a home where there are no other dogs. I'm ready to learn! I need a patient person who has the time to work on training with me. I would do best in a home with only adult humans. I love to be loved, but on my own terms! Let's brush up on some canine body language together!",

      "summaryHtml": "My foster writes: Gusto is the most curious pup I've ever met! He is always sniffing everything around him and he loves to explore! He also has the cutest little prance when we go on walks. His hips wag along with his tail and if you scratch his butt when he's walking he zooms along with his tail wagging. He is the gentlest dog i've ever met. When he takes a treat he sniffs it for a while before gently opening his mouth and taking it. He also loves to snuggle. You can hug him when he's laying with you and within minutes he'll be snoring louder than ever right in your ear! He is the best pup and I can't wait for him to have a forever home!\r\n\r\nGusto (210637) has been the perfect first foster! He is so sweet, so cuddly and so silly. He wants to be around his people whenever he can, if you're sitting on the couch he will definitely have his head or his whole body on top of you. He enjoys playtime, he loves fetch and tug of war. He is house broken and does all of his business outside! He walks super well, does not pull and does not react to other animals or people! Gusto is truly the sweetest dog and will make a wonderful best friend to the right family!\r\n\r\nGusto is a sweet-natured and loving dog who deserves a forever home. He acclimated to his new fosters, environment and surroundings relatively fast. He is potty trained and house broken, and never has had any accidents in the home. In terms of personality, he is silly, smart and just wants to cuddle with his human companions any chance he gets. He already knows some basic commands, but we've been training him on additional social skills and cues and he's learned within 3-4 days. He's been an absolute pleasure to have so far, and I can't wait to teach him more things so that he is ready to prance into his adopter's home soon!\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udfe1 My Ideal Home\r\nGusto is looking for an experienced adopter who can provide structure, daily exercise, and enrichment. An adult-only home would be best for this excitable pup, as he's still working on his manners and can get mouthy when overstimulated. Gusto would thrive with someone who's ready to channel his enthusiasm into fun training games, long walks, and lots of love.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc15 Good with Other Dogs?\r\nHe's been non-reactive on walks and greeted dogs gently through the fence. Off-leash, he may avoid overly rowdy dogs, so he might enjoy a calm canine companion or prefer to be your one-and-only.\r\n\r\n\ud83e\uddae Leash Manners\r\nGusto starts out a little bouncy but generally walks well on leash. He'll happily prance by your side and check in frequently-and he's great at turning every walk into a little adventure.\r\n\r\n\ud83e\ude7a Overall Health\r\nGusto is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccinations. He came in underweight but has gained healthy weight during his stay. He's been treated for occasional GI upset and skin sensitivities but is currently doing well.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf89 One Fun Fact\r\nA volunteer said it best: \"Gusto's joy is contagious. Even on the grayest, coldest days, he'll remind you to find something ",

She is very fast learner-her house training has been nearly painless, and she has adapted with great ease to our daily walk schedule, making full use of her time both to take care of herself, which she does efficiently and promptly, and to count the squirrels in Central Park. Her tail wags so fast that it becomes a blur, and she puts her hind quarters into it as well, greeting people and dogs with absolutely no worries that the world will not love her back. The doormen in our neighborhood step outside to greet her as she stands happily peering in at them, her tail ablaze. She really likes men! And men like her back. She's also SO eager to play with the other dogs-she bows down and sets the tail on \"fast\" mode when she sees one coming.\r\nShe sleeps through the night without stirring from her little bed on the floor next to me. We haven't heard her bark once. When fireworks went off for a long display before the NYC Marathon, she didn't even look up. She seems comfortable, secure, and just glad to be here. She has learned \"sit\" very quickly, and we are working on her one questionable habit, an exuberant hug that can come on just a little too strong, especially with that tail going full force. She's already greeting most people from a sit instead of a climb and with her quick learning skills, we think she will move past this insecurity. She does require about 15 minutes of daily belly rub time, while she tells you how much she loves you, and then she konks out for a long nap.\r\nShe's energetic, strong, loving and zesty, and would make a fantastic running buddy.\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>I love getting pets and - you guessed it - snuggles!</p>\r\n<p>I'm ready to learn! I need a patient person who has the time to work on training with me.</p>\r\n<p>I am playful and cute!</p>\r\nA Volunteer Wrote: Each of us likes to believe Gypsum loves us the most, but we have to admit she has been endlessly generous with her love since she first arrived! She wags her tail at absolutely everyone, and where most dogs enter the shelter scared (who could blame them?), the staff member who greeted her described her immediately as \"incredibly friendly and seeking affection.\" Gypsum loves to greet her walkers with a hug before the outdoor adventures begin, during which she shows off her great training and leash manners.  Gypsum is a heart-melter waiting to work her magic on you!\r\n\r\nMy boroughbreaker writes: Gypsum wants to greet every person and dog she sees! Not in an aggressive, demanding way, but rather in a hopeful, \"if I wag my tail hard enough, maybe they'll let me say hi\" way. Everyone LOVED her, and she got tons of pets and skritches. We walked around the park for five hours, and not once did she pull on her leash, or bark at another person or animal. ",

I'm good on the leash and will listen when you call my name even if I'm distracted by other dogs. I enjoy laying on the couch and riding in the car. I need to be the only dog in the house. With my foster I've learned to stop jumping on people when I'm excited. I'm eager to learn and brush up on my manners through positive reinforcement. I enjoy lots of attention and praise. I would make a great family dog.\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy Writes: On my borough break yesterday, I had the pleasure of spending the day with this amazing soul. She enjoys walks in the park, car rides, takes treats gently. Harper also is leash trained and walks by your side with minimal to no pulling. Throughout the entire time we were with her, she never showed any signs of aggressive behavior towards adults and children. It was easy for us to get her in and out of my car. She enjoyed the ride and was very relaxed. She is house broken and will let you know when she needs to go out. As an added bonus she loved to give kisses.  Harper is the perfect embodiment of warmth and affection. Her love for people and her gentle nature shine brightly. With such a loving personality, Harper surely brings light into every room she enters. Her forever home will be so lucky to welcome her.\r\n\r\nOh my gosh, I LOVED HARPER! She is truly an incredible dog. When she first came out of her kennel, she was shy and hesitant to leave the shelter, but the second we got in the car and headed to McDonald's (she's a HUGE fan of chicken nuggets and fries!), she completely came out of her shell.\r\nWe visited two different parks and walked over 4 miles together. Her tail never stopped wagging, and for about half the walk she proudly carried a toy in her mouth. She was an absolute love bug, soaking up pets, leaning her whole body into me, and just wanting affection.\r\nWe passed tons of dogs throughout the day; she'd glance at them but was super easy to redirect with a kissing noise or a treat. She loved greeting people too, and was so polite at Petco, she literally stood in line and waited her turn like a little lady.\r\nHarper really is such a wonderful dog. I hope someone gives her the chance she deserves, because she is a completely different dog outside the shelter. It absolutely broke my heart bringing her back especially because she didn't want to walk to her kennel until I walked with her.\r\n\r\nHarper first came to us via police 3 years ago when they found her wandering the streets. She was returned to her guardian not too long after that. Most recently, she was found again as a stray by a good samaritan in August. She has been quite the toy connoisseur with staff too, parading and tossing her toys around the room. During her greet with a female dog, she had a soft frame and wagging tail. She approached the other dog gently and creates distance when she becomes uncomfortable.",

I'm good on the leash and will listen when you call my name even if I'm distracted by other dogs. I enjoy laying on the couch and riding in the car. I need to be the only dog in the house. With my foster I've learned to stop jumping on people when I'm excited. I'm eager to learn and brush up on my manners through positive reinforcement. I enjoy lots of attention and praise. I would make a great family dog.\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy Writes: On my borough break yesterday, I had the pleasure of spending the day with this amazing soul. She enjoys walks in the park, car rides, takes treats gently. Harper also is leash trained and walks by your side with minimal to no pulling. Throughout the entire time we were with her, she never showed any signs of aggressive behavior towards adults and children. It was easy for us to get her in and out of my car. She enjoyed the ride and was very relaxed. She is house broken and will let you know when she needs to go out. As an added bonus she loved to give kisses.  Harper is the perfect embodiment of warmth and affection. Her love for people and her gentle nature shine brightly. With such a loving personality, Harper surely brings light into every room she enters. Her forever home will be so lucky to welcome her.\r\n\r\nOh my gosh, I LOVED HARPER! She is truly an incredible dog. When she first came out of her kennel, she was shy and hesitant to leave the shelter, but the second we got in the car and headed to McDonald's (she's a HUGE fan of chicken nuggets and fries!), she completely came out of her shell.\r\nWe visited two different parks and walked over 4 miles together. Her tail never stopped wagging, and for about half the walk she proudly carried a toy in her mouth. She was an absolute love bug, soaking up pets, leaning her whole body into me, and just wanting affection.\r\nWe passed tons of dogs throughout the day; she'd glance at them but was super easy to redirect with a kissing noise or a treat. She loved greeting people too, and was so polite at Petco, she literally stood in line and waited her turn like a little lady.\r\nHarper really is such a wonderful dog. I hope someone gives her the chance she deserves, because she is a completely different dog outside the shelter. It absolutely broke my heart bringing her back especially because she didn't want to walk to her kennel until I walked with her.\r\n\r\nHarper first came to us via police 3 years ago when they found her wandering the streets. She was returned to her guardian not too long after that. Most recently, she was found again as a stray by a good samaritan in August. She has been quite the toy connoisseur with staff too, parading and tossing her toys around the room. During her greet with a female dog, she had a soft frame and wagging tail. She approached the other dog gently and creates distance when she becomes uncomfortable.",

While he will approach handlers and gently take treats, he quickly becomes conflicted and stiffens, indicating discomfort with close contact.

He's a human connector, and while it was noted that he was dog reactive when he arrived in the shelter, in our dog-filled park time he did nothing but wag his tail and ignore the other passing dogs, including one who would have been happy to start an argument. Jaguar is the kind of company--kind, enthusiastically affectionate, and just happy to be along for the ride--that made us wish we could have spent hours with him. Imagine that he could be yours for a lifetime! Please come meet him at MACC.\u00a0",

      "summaryHtml": "Jammy Jam! While her past is a mystery it doesn't matter, Jam lives in the moment and has a pure zest for life. She's a senior gal but that doesn't slow her down. Jam's number one request is to be with her human. She'll wake up on your schedule and wait patiently for her favorite time of day, her morning walk! She does the most adorable tippy taps to show her excitement! On our walks Jam is excellent on a leash and polite with people and other dogs. She's been playful with dogs on leash so she may even do well with a doggy sibling! After our walk, it's time to play with toys or snooze in the sun in the yard. This loving and affection girl will wiggle her way into your heart as soon as you meet her and her unique look will make you fall in love!\r\n\r\nMy foster writes: Jam is truly man's best friend. Everywhere you go she wants to come with you radiating joy and gratitude that she's invited. She has the biggest smile and softest eyes. Walks will take 15 minutes longer because everyone will stop to tell you how cute your dog is. She can be a little impatient because she just wants to go from one adventure right into the next and she can struggle with separation anxiety when left alone. But it's all because she loves you and just wants to be with you 24/7. If you want a fiercely loyal companion who never takes for granted all that you do for her then Jam is the dog for you.\r\n\r\nThere is an adorable video of me on social media! <a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/gj4OofMy4IY?feature=share\"> Click here to experience the cuteness!</a> <br />\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udfe0 My Ideal Home\r\nJam would thrive with an adopter who appreciates her zest for life and can support her with enrichment, exercise, and structure. She's energetic for her age and loves to learn, so a home that can offer mental stimulation and force-free training will help her shine. Jam has some special medical needs, so a compassionate adopter willing to provide ongoing care is essential. A quieter home where she can be your one-and-only-or carefully introduced to other respectful dogs-would be ideal.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc36 Good with Other Dogs?\r\nJam has had a variety of playgroup experiences at the shelter-sometimes playful and bouncy, other times overstimulated or reactive depending on the dog. She's been used as a greeter dog and shown appropriate social skills, but also needs space when she's had enough. With the right match and slow intros, she may do well with a mellow companion.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc3e Leash Manners\r\nJam walks with mild to moderate pulling and can become reactive to other dogs on leash, especially in high-traffic areas. A front-clip harness and reward-based redirection are recommended. She's been working hard with our behavior team and shows great progress when engaged in training games like the \"123\" or \"Take A Breath\" exercises.\r\n",

Jam's number one request is to be with her human. She'll wake up on your schedule and wait patiently for her favorite time of day, her morning walk! She does the most adorable tippy taps to show her excitement! On our walks Jam is excellent on a leash and polite with people and other dogs. She's been playful with dogs on leash so she may even do well with a doggy sibling! After our walk, it's time to play with toys or snooze in the sun in the yard. This loving and affection girl will wiggle her way into your heart as soon as you meet her and her unique look will make you fall in love!\r\n\r\nMy foster writes: Jam is truly man's best friend. Everywhere you go she wants to come with you radiating joy and gratitude that she's invited. She has the biggest smile and softest eyes. Walks will take 15 minutes longer because everyone will stop to tell you how cute your dog is. She can be a little impatient because she just wants to go from one adventure right into the next and she can struggle with separation anxiety when left alone. But it's all because she loves you and just wants to be with you 24/7. If you want a fiercely loyal companion who never takes for granted all that you do for her then Jam is the dog for you.\r\n\r\nThere is an adorable video of me on social media! <a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/gj4OofMy4IY?feature=share\"> Click here to experience the cuteness!</a> <br />\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udfe0 My Ideal Home\r\nJam would thrive with an adopter who appreciates her zest for life and can support her with enrichment, exercise, and structure. She's energetic for her age and loves to learn, so a home that can offer mental stimulation and force-free training will help her shine. Jam has some special medical needs, so a compassionate adopter willing to provide ongoing care is essential. A quieter home where she can be your one-and-only-or carefully introduced to other respectful dogs-would be ideal.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc36 Good with Other Dogs?\r\nJam has had a variety of playgroup experiences at the shelter-sometimes playful and bouncy, other times overstimulated or reactive depending on the dog. She's been used as a greeter dog and shown appropriate social skills, but also needs space when she's had enough. With the right match and slow intros, she may do well with a mellow companion.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc3e Leash Manners\r\nJam walks with mild to moderate pulling and can become reactive to other dogs on leash, especially in high-traffic areas. A front-clip harness and reward-based redirection are recommended. She's been working hard with our behavior team and shows great progress when engaged in training games like the \"123\" or \"Take A Breath\" exercises.\r\n",

Jonny appreciates being spoken too in a soft voice, and cheese. Because Jonny was found alone in the apartment, we don't have any information about his life previously other than he lived with many dogs. We do know he is a very cute little guy with a funny face. He's extra furry and has the hint of a chow chow in his purple spotted tongue! He has been a tad of a nervous guy, but more recently he has gotten used to his new friends and props himself into laps! He's a soft cuddly guy who is perfect for the chilly fall nights coming soon. ",

Submit an application today to learn more about her!\r\n\r\nMy foster writes:\r\nKoda is a happy, affectionate girl who knows how to balance playtime and downtime. The second you walk in the door, she's on her back with her belly up, ready for rubs, and attention. She's just as content watching TV at your side as she is exploring the neighborhood on a sniff-filled walk, or entertaining herself with toys.\r\nShe's also incredibly smart and food-motivated (especially with peanut butter, but she hasn't met a snack she doesn't like!). Already clicker-trained and housebroken, she knows sit, stay, leave it, her name, and even advanced cues to help her focus and disengage when needed.\r\nWith her love of treats and eagerness to please, the sky's the limit for what she can learn next.\r\nHer routine is easy - a morning, evening, and bedtime walk - and she does great when left alone while I'm at the office. She's never met a stranger and soaks up attention from everyone.\r\nAt home, she loves sticking her nose out the window to feel the breeze, and she handles stairs with ease, making her a great fit for a walk-up apartment.\r\nShe's currently working with a trainer on her reactivity to other dogs, and she's already made tremendous progress. She's a quick study who responds beautifully to guidance, and she'll thrive in a home excited to continue her training journey.\r\nIf you're looking for a sweet, trainable, and adaptable companion who will happily be your shadow, cuddle buddy, and walking partner, Koda can't wait to meet you.\r\n\r\nMy foster writes:\r\nKoda is so sweet she just might give you diabetes! This cuddle bug loves nothing more than snuggling up and snoozing next to you on the couch. Koda is a great companion outside of the house too - she'll walk at your pace, as leisurely or as briskly as you would like. Koda makes friends with everyone she meets; she's an adorable, gentle, curious, open-hearted, wiggly good girl. Koda is super smart and loves her treats so she'll be able to pick up any new trick you'd like to teach her. She'll be your most loyal friend from the minute you take her home... come meet Koda today!!\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet!</p>\r\n<p>I would appreciate slow introductions to new people and places to help me feel safe.</p>\r\n<p>I need a home without cats or small animals.</p>\r\n<p>I would do best in a home without very tiny humans, although I could be open to older human children once I meet them.</p>\r\n<p>I'm sensitive and shy. I'll need extra help from you.</p>\r\n<p>I love getting pets and - you guessed it - snuggles!</p>\r\n<p>I will need daily physical activity to keep me healthy and happy!</p>\r\n\r\n",

Submit an application today to learn more about her!\r\n\r\nMy foster writes:\r\nKoda is a happy, affectionate girl who knows how to balance playtime and downtime. The second you walk in the door, she's on her back with her belly up, ready for rubs, and attention. She's just as content watching TV at your side as she is exploring the neighborhood on a sniff-filled walk, or entertaining herself with toys.\r\nShe's also incredibly smart and food-motivated (especially with peanut butter, but she hasn't met a snack she doesn't like!). Already clicker-trained and housebroken, she knows sit, stay, leave it, her name, and even advanced cues to help her focus and disengage when needed.\r\nWith her love of treats and eagerness to please, the sky's the limit for what she can learn next.\r\nHer routine is easy - a morning, evening, and bedtime walk - and she does great when left alone while I'm at the office. She's never met a stranger and soaks up attention from everyone.\r\nAt home, she loves sticking her nose out the window to feel the breeze, and she handles stairs with ease, making her a great fit for a walk-up apartment.\r\nShe's currently working with a trainer on her reactivity to other dogs, and she's already made tremendous progress. She's a quick study who responds beautifully to guidance, and she'll thrive in a home excited to continue her training journey.\r\nIf you're looking for a sweet, trainable, and adaptable companion who will happily be your shadow, cuddle buddy, and walking partner, Koda can't wait to meet you.\r\n\r\nMy foster writes:\r\nKoda is so sweet she just might give you diabetes! This cuddle bug loves nothing more than snuggling up and snoozing next to you on the couch. Koda is a great companion outside of the house too - she'll walk at your pace, as leisurely or as briskly as you would like. Koda makes friends with everyone she meets; she's an adorable, gentle, curious, open-hearted, wiggly good girl. Koda is super smart and loves her treats so she'll be able to pick up any new trick you'd like to teach her.

This sweet, low-maintenance girl is a professional snoozer who happily supervises the home or office from the comfort of her dog bed. She greets every human like an old friend, belly up and ready for head scratches, and has zero interest in chewing, barking, jumping on people or causing trouble.\r\nHer quirks? She's still learning that walks are for strolling, not shouting at other animals. She's also not the biggest fan of peanut butter or stairs (though she'll put up with both if she has to). Give her a crunchy snack, preferably plant-based-watermelon cubes, green beans, cabbage, cucumber, you name it-and she'll be your biggest fan.\r\nLaGuardia's motto: **nap hard, snack often, love everyone.** \ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udca4\r\n\r\nMy ideal home\r\n\r\nA calm, adult-only home that will give LGA time to decompress and continue positive-reinforcement training. She's easy-going inside, enjoys meeting new people, and thrives with a predictable routine, enrichment (sniffy walks, food puzzles), and lots of cuddle breaks. Adult-only (no children under 13). LGA is working on her confidence and can be uncomfortable around high-energy environments. LGA can become tense around other dogs on leash and has shown kennel reactivity. She may do best as the only pet while she builds skills.(Cats: unknown.)\r\n\r\nLeash Manners: Polite walker at your side once she settles in. When she sees other dogs, she may get stiff and focused; treats, distance, and a front-clip harness help her reset. She's learning check-ins and responds to patient, reward-based guidance.\r\n\r\n LGA is affectionate and leans in for pets-she simply needs consistent, kind coaching to feel secure. Her foster calls her a \"sweet, loving mush\" who will lounge near you all day.\r\n\r\nShe has a signature move: the \"apple alert.\" Bite into one and she'll appear with the cutest face, politely asking for a taste.\r\nShe is easy-going and calm, and loves meeting new people as long as they're willing to give her some pets. LGA has a lot of love \r\n\r\nMy foster writes: Let little LaGuardia love you! This perfect-sized munchkin wants nothing more than to snuggle and give kisses. A chill, low-energy dog, LGA doesn't need much in her golden years. While she does ask everyone to pay the cheese tax, really all that she wants is a quiet home, a comfy couch to lie on, and someone to be her favorite person to make her a happy girl!",

This sweet, low-maintenance girl is a professional snoozer who happily supervises the home or office from the comfort of her dog bed. She greets every human like an old friend, belly up and ready for head scratches, and has zero interest in chewing, barking, jumping on people or causing trouble.\r\nHer quirks? She's still learning that walks are for strolling, not shouting at other animals. She's also not the biggest fan of peanut butter or stairs (though she'll put up with both if she has to). Give her a crunchy snack, preferably plant-based-watermelon cubes, green beans, cabbage, cucumber, you name it-and she'll be your biggest fan.\r\nLaGuardia's motto: **nap hard, snack often, love everyone.** \ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udca4\r\n\r\nMy ideal home\r\n\r\nA calm, adult-only home that will give LGA time to decompress and continue positive-reinforcement training. She's easy-going inside, enjoys meeting new people, and thrives with a predictable routine, enrichment (sniffy walks, food puzzles), and lots of cuddle breaks. Adult-only (no children under 13). LGA is working on her confidence and can be uncomfortable around high-energy environments. LGA can become tense around other dogs on leash and has shown kennel reactivity. She may do best as the only pet while she builds skills.(Cats: unknown.)\r\n\r\nLeash Manners: Polite walker at your side once she settles in. When she sees other dogs, she may get stiff and focused; treats, distance, and a front-clip harness help her reset. She's learning check-ins and responds to patient, reward-based guidance.\r\n\r\n LGA is affectionate and leans in for pets-she simply needs consistent, kind coaching to feel secure. Her foster calls her a \"sweet, loving mush\" who will lounge near you all day.\r\n\r\nShe has a signature move: the \"apple alert.\" Bite into one and she'll appear with the cutest face, politely asking for a taste.\r\nShe is easy-going and calm, and loves meeting new people as long as they're willing to give her some pets. LGA has a lot of love \r\n\r\nMy foster writes: Let little LaGuardia love you! This perfect-sized munchkin wants nothing more than to snuggle and give kisses. A chill, low-energy dog, LGA doesn't need much in her golden years. While she does ask everyone to pay the cheese tax, really all that she wants is a quiet home, a comfy couch to lie on, and someone to be her favorite person to make her a happy girl!",

      "summaryHtml": "Meet Load O' Potatoes!\r\nFound as a stray and brought to the 90th Precinct before coming to ACC, this affectionate city walker is ready to trade kennel noise for cozy naps and neighborhood strolls. Volunteers rave about her sweet manners and cuddle game on BoroughBreaks.\r\n\r\nMy Ideal Home\r\nAn experienced, adult-only home that offers calm structure, patience, and a thoughtful decompression plan. Routine sniffy walks, enrichment (food puzzles, long-lasting chews), and reward-based training will help her shine. A front-clip harness and clear, consistent cues set her up for success.\r\n\r\nGood with Kids?\r\nRecommended adult-only (no children under 13) based on shelter observations and behavior team guidance.\r\n\r\nGood with Other Pets?\r\nBest as the only dog for now. In the busy kennel room she can be reactive (barking/lunging), but outdoors-with space and support-she often passes dogs without fuss. No dog parks. If you have a resident dog, plan slow, structured introductions with professional guidance. Potatoes needs a home without cats or small animals.\r\n\r\nLeash Manners\r\nOften a loose, thoughtful walker who checks in with her handler. If excited, she may briefly grab the leash; this has been easy to redirect with treats or a squeaker. She's tolerant of gentle petting during walk breaks and navigates sidewalks well when supported.\r\n\r\nOverall Health\r\nSpayed. Vet team notes dental tartar; regular dental care, balanced diet, and everyday exercise will help her feel her best. Previously had a shelter cough that resolved. (Your vet can personalize her wellness plan once home.)\r\n\r\nBehavior Determination & Other\r\nACC Behavior Level: 3\r\nRecommendations: Adult-only; no dog parks; front-clip harness; reward-based training to build focus around other dogs. In kennel/play-yard settings she may react toward neighboring dogs; on the street, distance and support help her stay composed.\r\n\r\nFun Facts\r\nHer BoroughBreak buddies called her \"an absolute angel\" with \"paw-tastic manners.\" Car-ride comfy, picnic-ready, generous with kisses, and a champion at settling after a good walk.\r\n\r\nReady to meet Load O' Potatoes?\r\nIf you love training, structure, and cuddly couch time-and you're ready to be her safe landing-Lo's your girl.\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy Writes: Lo was an absolute angel and pawtastic! She was very well-behaved and had great manners. She is very sweet and gave loads of kisses! She was never hesitant and was always ready for the next adventure!\r\n\r\nA Volunteer Wrote: I first met her flat on her back. She had thrown herself down, in a fit of pleasure, on the sidewalk, and was scratching her back on the cement and wriggling around and wagging her tail, while her borough break buddy looked equally delighted. \"She's just the best!\" she reported in on her morning with our girl. She's endlessly affectionate, has fantastic manners, and is adored by all of us because she's been here long enough for us all to fall in love. Please--come break her out, once and for all, and let the back scratches begin!\r\n",

      "description_html": "Meet Load O' Potatoes!\r\nFound as a stray and brought to the 90th Precinct before coming to ACC, this affectionate city walker is ready to trade kennel noise for cozy naps and neighborhood strolls. Volunteers rave about her sweet manners and cuddle game on BoroughBreaks.\r\n\r\nMy Ideal Home\r\nAn experienced, adult-only home that offers calm structure, patience, and a thoughtful decompression plan. Routine sniffy walks, enrichment (food puzzles, long-lasting chews), and reward-based training will help her shine. A front-clip harness and clear, consistent cues set her up for success.\r\n\r\nGood with Kids?\r\nRecommended adult-only (no children under 13) based on shelter observations and behavior team guidance.\r\n\r\nGood with Other Pets?\r\nBest as the only dog for now. In the busy kennel room she can be reactive (barking/lunging), but outdoors-with space and support-she often passes dogs without fuss. No dog parks. If you have a resident dog, plan slow, structured introductions with professional guidance. Potatoes needs a home without cats or small animals.\r\n\r\nLeash Manners\r\nOften a loose, thoughtful walker who checks in with her handler. If excited, she may briefly grab the leash; this has been easy to redirect with treats or a squeaker. She's tolerant of gentle petting during walk breaks and navigates sidewalks well when supported.\r\n\r\nOverall Health\r\nSpayed. Vet team notes dental tartar; regular dental care, balanced diet, and everyday exercise will help her feel her best. Previously had a shelter cough that resolved. (Your vet can personalize her wellness plan once home.)\r\n\r\nBehavior Determination & Other\r\nACC Behavior Level: 3\r\nRecommendations: Adult-only; no dog parks; front-clip harness; reward-based training to build focus around other dogs. In kennel/play-yard settings she may react toward neighboring dogs; on the street, distance and support help her stay composed.\r\n\r\nFun Facts\r\nHer BoroughBreak buddies called her \"an absolute angel\" with \"paw-tastic manners.\" Car-ride comfy, picnic-ready, generous with kisses, and a champion at settling after a good walk.\r\n\r\nReady to meet Load O' Potatoes?\r\nIf you love training, structure, and cuddly couch time-and you're ready to be her safe landing-Lo's your girl.\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy Writes: Lo was an absolute angel and pawtastic! She was very well-behaved and had great manners. She is very sweet and gave loads of kisses! She was never hesitant and was always ready for the next adventure!\r\n\r\nA Volunteer Wrote: I first met her flat on her back. She had thrown herself down, in a fit of pleasure, on the sidewalk, and was scratching her back on the cement and wriggling around and wagging her tail, while her borough break buddy looked equally delighted. \"She's just the best!\" she reported in on her morning with our girl. She's endlessly affectionate, has fantastic manners, and is adored by all of us because she's been here long enough for us all to fall in love. Please--come break her out, once and for all, and let the back scratches begin!\r\n",

She's a wonderful blend of energetic explorer and devoted couch potato, and she's sure to bring so much joy to the right family.\r\n\u2028Lucy is incredibly affectionate. My favorite moments were our quiet mornings, sipping coffee while she dozed off for a cuddle. She loves nothing more than snuggling up on your lap or resting her head on your arm in the evening. She's a gentle soul who will let you play with her ears and takes treats from your hand with the softest mouth.\u2028Lucy is a fantastic walking companion! She has a natural enthusiasm for other dogs and is very eager to greet and play with them some day. She also has a quirky love for high places and will seek out am elevated ledge to survey her kingdom. She adorably also is scared of escalators!\r\n\u2028Like any smart and energetic dog, Lucy is still learning her manners. She has so much love to give and will reward her new family with endless snuggles and unwavering loyalty. She is a lovable little angel who truly deserves a patient, loving forever home.\r\n\r\nMy foster writes:\r\nLucy is a wonderful girl with a sweet, puppylike nature. She adores humans, so much so that\r\nwhen you first meet Lucy, she will greet you with high-energy enthusiasm, but she's a champion snuggler at heart. Her perfect evening is a movie night after day with lots of walks, tucked right next to you, ideally with a peanut butter Kong for a snack. While she's still learning tricks and cues, Lucy is smart and curious and eager to please, making her a great student for training. Lucy is also endearingly clumsy! She doesn't always know where her legs are, which leads to the occasional trip and tumble, and it makes getting in and out of the car or up onto the couch an awfully cute spectacle. Her biggest dream is to finally get to play in a dog park!\r\nLucy deserves the world and will make a fantastic family member.\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>I would appreciate slow introductions to new people and places to help me feel safe.</p>\r\n<p>I love to be loved, but on my own terms! Let's brush up on some canine body language together!</p>\r\n<p>I would do best in a home with only adult humans.</p>\r\n<p>I'm ready to learn! I need a patient person who has the time to work on training with me.</p>",

Luffy is winning hearts here, as well; despite being in a pop up crate against the\u00a0wall, he makes friends by offering kisses through the bars until someone relents and plays with him. Luffy is looking for his forever playmate and a life not lived in a crate--please come meet him!",

She's smart, playful, and always ready to bring joy to those around her. I'm constantly amazed by how much love she has to give-not just to me, but to everyone she meets.\r\nShe's grown into a confident and social senior pup, always excited to make new friends, both human and furry. She gets along well with other dogs and even cats, as long as she's introduced to them at her own pace. While she can be a little cautious with strangers at first, it never takes long for her warm and loving nature to shine through.\r\nOne of MJ's most special traits is her intuition. She always seems to know when I need comfort, whether I'm feeling down or just in need of a little extra affection. Her playful energy is infectious, whether she's eagerly playing tug-of-war or trotting happily beside me on a walk.\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>I need a home where there are no other dogs.</p>\r\n<p>I need a home without cats or small animals.</p>\r\n<p>I would do best in a home with only adult humans.</p>\r\n<p>I don't always like to share my food, toys or bedding with other animals.</p>\r\n<p>I'm ready to learn!

She's smart, playful, and always ready to bring joy to those around her. I'm constantly amazed by how much love she has to give-not just to me, but to everyone she meets.\r\nShe's grown into a confident and social senior pup, always excited to make new friends, both human and furry. She gets along well with other dogs and even cats, as long as she's introduced to them at her own pace. While she can be a little cautious with strangers at first, it never takes long for her warm and loving nature to shine through.\r\nOne of MJ's most special traits is her intuition. She always seems to know when I need comfort, whether I'm feeling down or just in need of a little extra affection. Her playful energy is infectious, whether she's eagerly playing tug-of-war or trotting happily beside me on a walk.\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>I need a home where there are no other dogs.</p>\r\n<p>I need a home without cats or small animals.</p>\r\n<p>I would do best in a home with only adult humans.</p>\r\n<p>I don't always like to share my food, toys or bedding with other animals.</p>\r\n<p>I'm ready to learn!

      "description": "My foster wrote: Marge is a dog that is just truly enjoyable to be around. I can't say it more plainly than that! She is fun, energetic, cuddly, smart, and really is a good girl who wants to learn and do the right thing! Going on this adventure together, developing trust, and watching her blossom into the smart, confident, bird watcher (hunter wannabe), that she is has been amazing! She's such a friendly, funny, sweet dog who loves to be loved and shower everyone with that love. She adores her pup cups at the cafe on Saturday mornings, almost as much as her pup cups at her Friday night happy hours. At both, she is the epitome of polite patience, although she will expect some additional bites of pizza or olive oil cake for that patience. She has never gotten aggressive with any dog or loud noise passing by either. When left alone, she may have an accident at first if she's scared, but building up trust with Marge is essential. Once that trust is built, it's there forever and she'll try to never have an accident inside again, even if she has to be alone on the 4th of July! On leash, Marge walks like the supermodel she was born to be. She rarely pulls and will stroll leisurely and stop to smell flowers (or the occasional bag of trash). She does love a road snack though, so being attentive is a must because this gal will scarf down an old piece chicken faster than you can say drop it! Speaking of food, this lady literally jumps for joy at dinner time and it cracks us up everyday. If you work from home, you'll have a new office mate who snores and will randomly bring you socks sometimes. She never chews them, just finds them near the hamper and gently leaves them on your lap or holds them right by you and waits for you to take it. Only socks, nothing else. I call them her offerings. I can go on and on, but in the end, Marge is a quirky, fun, dog and deserves the best quirky, fun, New Yorker to be her forever friend! So come meet Margarina Moss, supermodel of dogs and see for yourself! What my friends at ACC say about me: I would appreciate slow introductions to new people and places to help me feel safe. I would do best in a home without very tiny humans, although I could be open to older human children once I meet them. I love to be loved, but on my own terms! Let's brush up on some canine body language together!",

She wants nothing more than to lay with you on the couch or bed and snuggle up to you or to bring her ball to you and play. She has been learning to walk nicely on the leash and absolutely loves being outside. She is friendly to people and kids and greets everyone with her tail wagging. Mika does snore when she sleeps and can even snore when she's awake! She takes treats very gently and knows how to sit, stay or give paw for treats. She will benefit from plenty of exercise, food puzzles and interaction with you. She should be the only pet in the home and, because of her strength and excitability, a home with no small children.\r\n\r\nMy foster writes: If I had to describe Mika in a single word, it would be exuberant! She is a joyful and loving companion who wants to become friends with every living creature she meets. While she is certainly energetic she is also equally cuddly, and is happy following a good round of exercise with cuddling close on the sofa to watch a show. She's also so eager to please that she learns quickly, having picked up several new commands with minimal effort. She would be certain to brighten any home she enters!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mika is a fun-loving pup who loves to explore her surroundings. She is still adjusting to being around other dogs, cats, and squirrels, and is working on her leash manners. Mika has a lot of energy and would benefit from a patient, experienced owner who can help her reach her full potential.  With the right home, Mika could thrive and become a loyal companion</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>My ideal home:</b> Mika will succeed in an experienced home without tiny humans or other animals. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

She wants nothing more than to lay with you on the couch or bed and snuggle up to you or to bring her ball to you and play. She has been learning to walk nicely on the leash and absolutely loves being outside. She is friendly to people and kids and greets everyone with her tail wagging. Mika does snore when she sleeps and can even snore when she's awake! She takes treats very gently and knows how to sit, stay or give paw for treats. She will benefit from plenty of exercise, food puzzles and interaction with you. She should be the only pet in the home and, because of her strength and excitability, a home with no small children.\r\n\r\nMy foster writes: If I had to describe Mika in a single word, it would be exuberant! She is a joyful and loving companion who wants to become friends with every living creature she meets. While she is certainly energetic she is also equally cuddly, and is happy following a good round of exercise with cuddling close on the sofa to watch a show. She's also so eager to please that she learns quickly, having picked up several new commands with minimal effort. She would be certain to brighten any home she enters!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mika is a fun-loving pup who loves to explore her surroundings. She is still adjusting to being around other dogs, cats, and squirrels, and is working on her leash manners. Mika has a lot of energy and would benefit from a patient, experienced owner who can help her reach her full potential.  With the right home, Mika could thrive and become a loyal companion</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>My ideal home:</b> Mika will succeed in an experienced home without tiny humans or other animals. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "summaryHtml": "Miss Missy is a bright and enthusiastic pup enrolled in our Shelter Scholars program, where she's working on developing better manners and learning how to engage with the world in a polite and thoughtful way. Through structured enrichment, confidence-building exercises, and stress-reducing activities, Miss Missy is practicing skills like polite greetings, patience, and calm interactions. Using positive reinforcement training, she's making great strides in learning when to engage, when to wait, and how to respond to exciting situations with grace!\r\n\r\nMy previous foster writes: Miss Missy has been such a pleasure to have in my home. She is a very sweet loving girl that enjoys butt rubs, head rubs and giving the occasional wet kiss on my cheek! She loves to lounge on the couch for her naps or rest her head in my lap while we watch tv. Occasionally when Miss Missy is feeling a little bossy; she'll take her nose and pick my hand up to give her some head rubs! She even knows cues such as sit, lay down and paw. This wonderful lil lady is also house trained and has never gone potty inside. This is my first time fostering and Miss Missy has been a delight and the ideal dog!\r\n\r\nA Volunteer writes: Miss Missy will woo you with her affection and adorable habit of sitting on cue for treats. She knows \"sit\" and \"paw\" and, at just over a year old, has so much potential to learn more in a foster or forever home! An easy walker, even for new volunteers, she loves exploring on long walks and sometimes rolls in the grass. This silly girl has even been spotted snoring in her kennel. As one of the shelter's long-timers, she dreams of a real home to snooze in. For now, Miss Missy should be the only pet.\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy Writes: Miss Missy was a very good girl! A few things I noticed on our walk was she was reactive to other dogs, car sounds, and men specifically, and a bit of a leash puller. She's a very strong girl! She took her treats well and liked to lean her weight into us. Next time I will hope to take her indoors and get to socialize with her more as she was a little overwhelmed and on alert at all times with her surroundings outside.</p>\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy Writes: We took a nice car ride, she enthusiastically explored the apartment smelling where all the dogs had been before but quickly settled in to watching me make some lunch, we played with dog toys and snuggled on the sofa and gave lots of kisses. She was immediately VERY affectionate wanting pets, belly rubs and cuddles. We took a nice nap on the sofa together and then played some more. She has the SOFTEST most velvety ears.'\r\n\r\nMy adoption fee has been sponsored thanks to a generous donor! </p>\r\n\r\n",

Through structured enrichment, confidence-building exercises, and stress-reducing activities, Miss Missy is practicing skills like polite greetings, patience, and calm interactions. Using positive reinforcement training, she's making great strides in learning when to engage, when to wait, and how to respond to exciting situations with grace!\r\n\r\nMy previous foster writes: Miss Missy has been such a pleasure to have in my home. She is a very sweet loving girl that enjoys butt rubs, head rubs and giving the occasional wet kiss on my cheek! She loves to lounge on the couch for her naps or rest her head in my lap while we watch tv. Occasionally when Miss Missy is feeling a little bossy; she'll take her nose and pick my hand up to give her some head rubs! She even knows cues such as sit, lay down and paw. This wonderful lil lady is also house trained and has never gone potty inside. This is my first time fostering and Miss Missy has been a delight and the ideal dog!\r\n\r\nA Volunteer writes: Miss Missy will woo you with her affection and adorable habit of sitting on cue for treats. She knows \"sit\" and \"paw\" and, at just over a year old, has so much potential to learn more in a foster or forever home! An easy walker, even for new volunteers, she loves exploring on long walks and sometimes rolls in the grass. This silly girl has even been spotted snoring in her kennel. As one of the shelter's long-timers, she dreams of a real home to snooze in. For now, Miss Missy should be the only pet.\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy Writes: Miss Missy was a very good girl! A few things I noticed on our walk was she was reactive to other dogs, car sounds, and men specifically, and a bit of a leash puller. She's a very strong girl! She took her treats well and liked to lean her weight into us. Next time I will hope to take her indoors and get to socialize with her more as she was a little overwhelmed and on alert at all times with her surroundings outside.</p>\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy Writes: We took a nice car ride, she enthusiastically explored the apartment smelling where all the dogs had been before but quickly settled in to watching me make some lunch, we played with dog toys and snuggled on the sofa and gave lots of kisses. She was immediately VERY affectionate wanting pets, belly rubs and cuddles. We took a nice nap on the sofa together and then played some more. She has the SOFTEST most velvety ears.'\r\n\r\nMy adoption fee has been sponsored thanks to a generous donor! </p>\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Meet Missy! Missy was brought to us as an owner surrender and is a delightful, social butterfly. She loves being in the presence of family and strangers alike, showing off her friendly and outgoing nature. My Ideal Home Missy will thrive in an adult-only home where she can enjoy a calm environment. A household familiar with managing medium energy levels would suit her well, ensuring she gets her daily walks and the affection she adores. A place without children or cats is ideal, as well as a family that understands her on-leash reactivity and can provide positive reinforcement. Good with Kids? No, Missy is not comfortable around children and may react with barking or growling. An adult-only home is recommended. Good with Other Pets? Missy prefers to avoid other dogs and is not suited for a home with cats, as she may react to them with barking or growling. She thrives best in a pet-free environment. Leash Manners Missy walks well on a leash with minimal pulling, though she might react to dogs and strangers approaching her by barking or growling. Regular walks and continued leash training would benefit her greatly. Overall Health Healthy overall. Behavior Determination Experienced Adopters Only: Missy needs a home where her resource guarding can be managed, and her potential for defensive behavior around children, dogs, and unfamiliar situations can be addressed with understanding and care. Other Fun Facts Missy is incredibly affectionate and thoroughly loves attention and hugs! She is treat motivated, with bacon being a particular favorite.

She is excited to meet every person and every dog, she loves treats, and sleeps like a champ (I often have to wake her up myself to start the day!). She has no separation anxiety and greets you at the door with one of her stuffies, just excited to see you. She has no stranger danger and doesn't bark (except on rare occasions when she really wants to play with a dog who isn't interested in her!). She's an absolute delight.\r\n\r\nThere is an adorable video of me on social media! <a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/KJv8ETH5DWA?feature=share\"> Click here to experience the cuteness!</a> <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet!</p>\r\n<p>I have medical needs that staff will address with you when you meet me.</p>\r\n<p>I need a home without cats or small animals.</p>\r\n<p>I love to be loved, but on my own terms!

I had the joy of taking her out on a BoroughBreak, and she was an absolute delight from start to finish. Calm and loving, Misty walked beautifully on leash, never pulling-just enjoying the sunshine and soft breeze with quiet grace. She lit up for treats and gave the warmest tail wags to everyone we passed. Misty was wonderfully composed around other dogs, showing only friendly interest and a desire to play. She's a true family dog-great with kids, affectionate with people, and full of that soft, steady energy that makes a house feel like home. If you're looking for a loyal companion with a heart full of love and a peaceful spirit, Misty is the girl for you. Let her be your sunshine every day. \ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\udc3e\r\n\r\nA volunteer writes: Misty is exactly our type. A 10 year old senior grandma, with lots of spunk. She's ready for mall walking, 4 pm happy hours, and adult only resort vacations. She has ears that always lean to her left.\r\nMisty was found loose in a Kissena Park in Queens with a leash and collar but no owner in sight. When we meet Misty, she hops right into the pool. She's not wasting any time outside on this warm day, and gently splishes and splashes while she cools off. After she finishes her swim time, Misty plops down with a stuffed piggie in the yard. Misty will need some medical follow up for a few masses she has. She is clearly a delight and a bright light that deserves to shine for whatever time she has left.",

She is excited to meet every person and every dog, she loves treats, and sleeps like a champ (I often have to wake her up myself to start the day!). She has no separation anxiety and greets you at the door with one of her stuffies, just excited to see you. She has no stranger danger and doesn't bark (except on rare occasions when she really wants to play with a dog who isn't interested in her!). She's an absolute delight.\r\n\r\nThere is an adorable video of me on social media! <a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/KJv8ETH5DWA?feature=share\"> Click here to experience the cuteness!</a> <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet!</p>\r\n<p>I have medical needs that staff will address with you when you meet me.</p>\r\n<p>I need a home without cats or small animals.</p>\r\n<p>I love to be loved, but on my own terms! Let's brush up on some canine body language together!</p>\r\n<p>I would appreciate slow introductions to new people and places to help me feel safe.</p>\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy Writes: Misty is the sweetest, most gentle soul you'll ever have the pleasure of walking. I had the joy of taking her out on a BoroughBreak, and she was an absolute delight from start to finish. Calm and loving, Misty walked beautifully on leash, never pulling-just enjoying the sunshine and soft breeze with quiet grace. She lit up for treats and gave the warmest tail wags to everyone we passed. Misty was wonderfully composed around other dogs, showing only friendly interest and a desire to play. She's a true family dog-great with kids, affectionate with people, and full of that soft, steady energy that makes a house feel like home. If you're looking for a loyal companion with a heart full of love and a peaceful spirit, Misty is the girl for you. Let her be your sunshine every day. \ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\udc3e\r\n\r\nA volunteer writes: Misty is exactly our type. A 10 year old senior grandma, with lots of spunk. She's ready for mall walking, 4 pm happy hours, and adult only resort vacations. She has ears that always lean to her left.\r\nMisty was found loose in a Kissena Park in Queens with a leash and collar but no owner in sight. When we meet Misty, she hops right into the pool. She's not wasting any time outside on this warm day, and gently splishes and splashes while she cools off. After she finishes her swim time, Misty plops down with a stuffed piggie in the yard. Misty will need some medical follow up for a few masses she has. She is clearly a delight and a bright light that deserves to shine for whatever time she has left.",

Her favorite place is cuddled up next to you on the couch, and she will follow you room to room wherever you go. She loves to play tug of war, and she has a big goofy personality that'll make you laugh. She'll have short bursts of playful energy, but she's also totally content to curl up on the couch throughout the day. She also makes the cutest little grunts/snorts when she's happily eating.\r\nOther things to note:\r\n- She's housebroken (will only go to the bathroom outside or on the wee wee pad if necessary).\r\n- She's great with meeting new people in a calm setting.\r\n- She loves peanut butter and cheese.\r\n- She is obsessed with squirrels and will scan every tree and bush to look for them.\r\n- She barks occasionally but is easily shushed.\r\n- She sleeps well in her crate as long as it's near you, and she is happy to sleep in with you.\r\n- She would probably be best with someone who works from home, as she doesn't enjoy being left on her own.\r\nShe would be such a joy for any person or family!!\r\n\r\nMy boroughbreaker writes: We had the best time with Miss Narnia! She was playful and affectionate! She warmed up to us pretty quickly and was such a silly, wonderful dog!\r\nThings to know about Narnia:\r\n- She has the softest fur ever. It is like silk and velvet combined.\r\n- She has a lot of fun and sweet energy! I think she would do well with a home where she has space to get her zoomies out!\r\n- She LOVES squirrels. Once she sees one, she is locked in.\r\nThings Narnia loves:\r\n- Cheese (a past boroughbreak walker said she wasn't food motivated, but with cheese she definitely seemed to be! She quickly learned sit and she started doing paw!)\r\n- Somersaults. She loves to roll on top of you head first! It is the cutest thing!\r\n- Rubbing her body on your legs and furniture. She's like a cat in that way!\r\n- Icecubes.she had a blast playing with ice cubes, moving them around the floor and eating them haha.\r\nThings Narnia may need help with:\r\n- Pulling on leash\r\n- Feeling safe and comfy in new places - once we got to my apartment she was fighting sleep, any little noise would wake her up! But once she got settled (which was pretty quickly) she finally let herself rest.\r\n",

      "summaryHtml": "<span style=\"color:#00a7b5; font-weight:bold;\">Meet Orbot!</span><br />\r\nBrought to ACC as a found dog, Orbot has the calm, thoughtful vibe of a seasoned companion. He walks politely, accepts gentle pets, and takes treats with care. Shelter life makes him a little anxious in his kennel, but once he's out, he shows you his easygoing side and a soft spot for snacks.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#00a7b5; font-weight:bold;\">My Ideal Home</span><br />\r\nI'll do best with patient adopters who can offer a quiet space, predictable routines, and plenty of reassurance while I decompress from the shelter. Give me unhurried walks, comfy naps, and simple enrichment (sniffy strolls, food puzzles), and I'll settle in nicely.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#00a7b5; font-weight:bold;\">Good with Kids?</span><br />\r\nBest without very young children. I can vocalize in my kennel when stressed and prefer a calm, gentle approach; dog-savvy older kids/teens could be a fit after a meet-and-greet.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#00a7b5; font-weight:bold;\">Good with Other Pets?</span><br />\r\nWe don't have a known history. My dog-to-dog interactions here are inconclusive, so slow, supervised introductions are recommended if you have resident pets.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#00a7b5; font-weight:bold;\">Leash Manners</span><br />\r\nPolite and steady. I walk ahead without pulling, follow along nicely, and check in for treats like a gentleman.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#00a7b5; font-weight:bold;\">Overall Health</span><br />\r\nHealthy overall with a brief stress-tummy episode that's being supported with simple care. Heartworm test negative. The shelter vet issued a spay/neuter waiver due to surgical risk in a shelter setting; your vet can advise about any future procedures.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#00a7b5; font-weight:bold;\">Behavior Determination</span><br />\r\nExperienced Adopters (Level 3): I'm easy to handle out of the kennel but can bark or growl when stressed in the kennel environment. With a low-key home, positive reinforcement, and time to decompress, I'm set up to thrive.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#00a7b5; font-weight:bold;\">Other Fun Facts</span><br />\r\nI'm food-motivated (canned food and... a little SPAM, please), take treats gently, and love a calm stroll. If you're looking for a wise, well-mannered buddy to share the quiet moments, I'm your guy.\r\n\r\nA Volunteer Wrote: The only thing sadder than seeing an older dog in the shelter (when he might be living out his days in a loving home) is seeing an older dog who seems so defeated by it all. Orbot has the most perfect manners with all he comes into contact with, and has the sweetest face and disposition, but he's not coming into contact with people the way he so deserves. If you have spare room on your couch, Orbot is just waiting to be loved back to life!",

She was quite reactive when seeing other dogs while on leash, jumping and running around me (she's pretty strong), but as we spent more time together i was better able to help her calm down. She overall did really well walking on the leash in the streets. Over time she became more responsive to me and very trusting. She responded to sit and down commands. Once we got to my apartment, she was curious and sniffed around where she could, and was super snuggly with me, even climbing into my lap :) Not sure if she's fully house trained, but in the time we spent at my apartment she didn't have any accidents and i think she let me know when she needed to go out.\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet!</p>\r\n<p>I would appreciate slow introductions to new people and places to help me feel safe.</p>\r\n<p>I would do best in a home without very tiny humans, although I could be open to older human children once I meet them.</p>\r\n<p>I love to be loved, but on my own terms!

He tells you how much he enjoys your touch by leaning into your legs or giving you his belly. He acts more like a nervous puppy, despite his sleek and confident look. He flops about when he returns a ball or toy during fetch, as if he is trying to throw it himself. He will lean in against you when he is nervous but treats and lots of \"good boys\" does the trick to calm him down. In many ways he is a homebody as he likes the comfort and safety of being with you in a quiet environment with people he trusts. He is not a couch potato, rather he lets you do you while he enjoys his chew toys. He has certain behaviors that tell you he needs to go out to relieve himself and listens well to commands like heel, sit and stay. If he gets a little zany, he is telling you he needs to go out. Once he's finished his business (a short or long walk does the trick) he will settle in for a cozy nap or some serious puzzle toy/treat.\r\n\r\nMy foster writes: My name is Poptart for good reason! Just like the pastry I will fill you up with sweetness on the inside and my beautiful caramel, cinnamon color on the outside. I'm a two-year-old boy who loves walking or running - you set the pace and I will follow. I'm eager to learn more tricks and will do anything for a treat! Toss me a biscuit, a bone, a piece of carrot or apple and I will heel, sit and come right to your side. Just click your tongue and you have my attention! Even a squirrel can't compete for my attention if there's a treat in your hand. I am learning manners around other dogs and people, so I would do best with someone who doesn't have a dog at home and who can teach me good manners and new tricks. I also love my chew toys and can keep myself busy, but if you have a free hand I am always up for a good head scratch, which leads to a back scratch and that soft white furry spot under my chin hairs! I will tell you if I need to go out by standing at the door or pushing my nose into you. I would make an excellent companion but if you have kids, my energy level would be best pared with older kids who will play with me. I would thrive in a home where I'm included in daily activities and given lots of love, especially hugs! I love those! If you're looking for a loyal, affectionate and energetic companion to grow old with, then I've been looking for you too!\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet!</p>\r\n<p>I would appreciate slow introductions to new people and places to help me feel safe.</p>\r\n<p>I love getting pets and - you guessed it - snuggles!</p>",

With a name like his, it's no surprise this five-year-old brindle boy has a lot of heart-and a lot of energy. Loyal, sensitive, and super smart, Prince Charming is hoping to find a family who will help him channel his enthusiasm and give him the structure and love he craves.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**My ideal home:**\r\nPrince Charming is looking for an experienced adult-only home where he can thrive in a calm, structured environment. He'll do best with someone who understands working with high-energy dogs and is committed to positive reinforcement training. A home with a yard to stretch his legs-or a person who enjoys long walks and enrichment games-would be ideal.\r\n\r\n**Good with kids?**\r\nNo. While he lived with young children in his previous home, due to his resource guarding, anxiety, and impulsive behavior, we recommend a home without children under 13.\r\n\r\n**Good with other pets?**\r\nPrince Charming lived peacefully with a cat and was described as friendly and playful with familiar dogs. At the shelter, he's shown some nervousness and overexcitement around unfamiliar dogs. If joining a home with another dog, structured introductions and slow acclimation are a must.\r\n\r\n**Leash manners:**\r\nThis boy has a lot of energy on leash! He pulls and may lunge at small animals, but he's been making progress with decompression walks and reward-based training like \"up/down\" games, polite exchanges, and focus work. A front-clip harness and patience will go a long way.\r\n\r\n**Overall health:**\r\nPrince Charming is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines. He had a bout of kennel cough and some GI issues early on but has since recovered. He's currently a healthy 59-pound pup with a great appetite.\r\n\r\n**Behavior determination:**\r\n**Level 3** - Prince Charming is a bright, active dog who struggles with anxiety, low impulse control, and resource guarding. He's responded well to positive reinforcement techniques in the shelter and is ready for a savvy adopter who can continue building on that foundation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Fun facts about me:**\r\n\r\n* I love car rides and am crate trained for up to 8 hours\r\n* My previous family said I'm outgoing and playful\r\n* I enjoy toys, treats, and enrichment games-just be ready for a high jump or two!\r\n* I know how to sit, use wee-wee pads, and settle when given the right support\r\n* My adoption fee has been **sponsored**, thanks to generous supporters!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Ready to bring some royal energy into your life?** Prince Charming is full of love and potential-he just needs a family who can match his spirit and support his journey. If you're ready to meet your energetic new best friend, come see Prince today!\r\n",

Quinn also has an irresistible little dance that she shows off before heading outside for a walk; it's part prance, part excitement, fully adorable! She's great about sleeping through the night, gently snoring away she snoozes. During the day, her schedule includes lots of naps, and she always enjoys a kong or an enrichment toy. Quinn loves meeting new people, and she seems like she will be fine around other dogs because she shows no reactivity whatsoever when she's outdoors on a leash. Quinn might actually think she's a cat, because she's so content to be tranquil and cozy inside. Come meet Quinn to see her incredible personality for yourself - her mismatched floppy ears, her instant loyalty, and her mild and mellow temperament.\r\n\r\nThere is an adorable video of me on social media! <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DPWU3x9j_35/?hl=en\"> Click here to experience the cuteness!</a> <br />\r\n \r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet!</p>\r\n<p>It is unknown if I have ever lived with other animals or children.</p>\r\n<p>I would do best in a home without very tiny humans, although I could be open to older human children once I meet them.</p>\r\n<p>I'm sensitive and shy.

Sweet sweet!\" one volunteer writes about her because one \"sweet\" isn't enough, while another wants to make sure her gentleness and kindness are noted. For my part, I want to call attention to the heart-melting prance she does for treats, which should be its own category on Dancing with the Stars. Please, give this dog the home she so deserves!",

She's making steady progress in practicing calm, cooperative behavior and becoming more comfortable with sharing.\r\n\r\n**Meet Raven Roth!**\r\nRaven Roth was surrendered to ACC when her family moved. At just two years old, this stunning black beauty is both sensitive and playful. She's affectionate with people she trusts and shines once given time to warm up. Raven has lived with adults, a child, and another dog. Now she's seeking a patient, experienced adopter who can help her feel safe and supported.\r\n\r\n**My ideal home:**\r\nRaven would thrive in a quiet, adult-only home where she can build trust gradually. She needs someone who understands canine body language and can respect her space. A calm environment and routine will bring out her affectionate, playful side.\r\n\r\n**Good with other pets?**\r\nRaven lived with another dog and shows friendly, playful behavior once comfortable.

      "summaryHtml": "My foster writes: Ronnie may be the world's best cuddle buddy. All she needs to be happy is laying next to her person, getting some belly rubs or ear scratches. She enjoys going on long walks but also happy laying around. She's crate trained and will sleep late in the morning, but will do a little tippy-tap dance when she first sees you waking up. She's crate trained and almost completely housetrained. Her face is a little lopsided, which only adds to her appeal as she stares at you with a little wink and head tilt. Ronnie will make the perfect addition to a home, filling it with unending love.\r\n\r\n<b style=\"color:#00a7b5;\">Good with other pets?</b><br />\r\nRonnie has lived with other pets in her previous home. At the shelter, she politely greeted another dog through a gate and then kept to herself. We always suggest slow introductions with resident pets, and we offer a 2-week trial adoption to help you see if Ronnie is a good fit with your family. Since ACC doesn't test with cats, we're not sure how she'd do with new feline friends, but we can help you with tips and advice!<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<b style=\"color:#00a7b5;\">Good with kids?</b><br />\r\nDue to the behavior seen in the care center, we feel that Ronnie may be intimidated by young children. She needs a slow approach and time to warm up. She should never be forced to interact with new people, and should be allowed to greet and initiate an interaction at her own pace. Older, gentle children should have an in-depth interaction prior to adoption.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<b style=\"color:#00a7b5;\">How is my health?</b><br />\r\nRonnie has some health concerns that our staff will discuss with you.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<b style=\"color:#00a7b5;\">How are my leash manners?</b><br />\r\nRonnie pulls moderately on the leash and is nonreactive to humans and dogs on walks.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<b style=\"color:#00a7b5;\">What is my behavior assessment?</b><br />\r\nRonnie has been assessed as a Level 2 dog. She would love to meet an adopter that will allow her to decompress at her own pace. With patience and understanding, Ronnie would make a very special companion!<br /><br />",

This little sweetheart, adores belly rubs, gentle petting, and being combed. She loves showing her affection through sweet licks and kisses. When it comes to meal time, she's a perfect little lady. Like vegetable too but only when they're chopped up. She is really smart too- she knows how to follow cue like sit, paw, stay, and come. To keep her happy and healthy, she needs daily exercise, fun activities, and mental challenges. With a little practice and patience, she'll get the hang of leash training. And let me tell you, when she's on the move, her wiggly dance will steal your heart-it's like she's doing the worm!\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet!</p>\r\n<p>I would appreciate slow introductions to new people and places to help me feel safe.</p>\r\n<p>I would do best in a home without very tiny humans, although I could be open to older human children once I meet them.</p>\r\n<p>I love to be loved, but on my own terms! Let's brush up on some canine body language together!</p>\r\n\r\nA volunteer writes: Her hobby is flopping for belly rubs, which is convenient because ours is giving belly rubs! Sasha is, in a word, dreamy. I think she spent 90% of her time with us upside down, and the 10% she was right side up she was simply planning a flop so dramatically cute that we'd race over to rub her belly. Whether melting like a noodle against our legs while we pet her or literally just walking up to us and flopping unsolicited, it was all so perfect.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to put a dog so affectionate back in a kennel, and we are comforted knowing other volunteers have taken a few minutes to give Sasha a belly rub. But this beautiful young girl should be the center of someone's universe, receiving all the love and affection her heart desires. If you can give that to her, please visit Sasha at Queens ACC",

This little sweetheart, adores belly rubs, gentle petting, and being combed. She loves showing her affection through sweet licks and kisses. When it comes to meal time, she's a perfect little lady. Like vegetable too but only when they're chopped up. She is really smart too- she knows how to follow cue like sit, paw, stay, and come. To keep her happy and healthy, she needs daily exercise, fun activities, and mental challenges. With a little practice and patience, she'll get the hang of leash training. And let me tell you, when she's on the move, her wiggly dance will steal your heart-it's like she's doing the worm!\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet!</p>\r\n<p>I would appreciate slow introductions to new people and places to help me feel safe.</p>\r\n<p>I would do best in a home without very tiny humans, although I could be open to older human children once I meet them.</p>\r\n<p>I love to be loved, but on my own terms! Let's brush up on some canine body language together!</p>\r\n\r\nA volunteer writes: Her hobby is flopping for belly rubs, which is convenient because ours is giving belly rubs! Sasha is, in a word, dreamy. I think she spent 90% of her time with us upside down, and the 10% she was right side up she was simply planning a flop so dramatically cute that we'd race over to rub her belly. Whether melting like a noodle against our legs while we pet her or literally just walking up to us and flopping unsolicited, it was all so perfect.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to put a dog so affectionate back in a kennel, and we are comforted knowing other volunteers have taken a few minutes to give Sasha a belly rub. But this beautiful young girl should be the center of someone's universe, receiving all the love and affection her heart desires. If you can give that to her, please visit Sasha at Queens ACC",

He did a big, satisfying stretch and repositioned his big 70lb body. I blinked and imagined this same scene unfolding in a home. But today Silver is in that same kennel, after being found in a park 45 days ago. Reported friendly by the police who brought him in, he's been understandably scared during his time here. In spite of that he's also leaned in to petting during his assessment and greeted in a social manner. Now Silver is looking for a home to stretch his big body in. He's estimated to be 5 and the shelter is looking for a home with some experience to care for him. You can meet Silver at Queens ACC",

He did a big, satisfying stretch and repositioned his big 70lb body. I blinked and imagined this same scene unfolding in a home. But today Silver is in that same kennel, after being found in a park 45 days ago. Reported friendly by the police who brought him in, he's been understandably scared during his time here. In spite of that he's also leaned in to petting during his assessment and greeted in a social manner. Now Silver is looking for a home to stretch his big body in. He's estimated to be 5 and the shelter is looking for a home with some experience to care for him. You can meet Silver at Queens ACC",

He is completely respectful of belongings and sleeps politely on his bed or rugs unless you explicitly invite him to the couch. He does not bark or pay any attention to neighbors in the hallway, and is often still asleep when you come home! Sometimes he even sleeps by the door waiting for you to come back and play! He loves long walks where he can smell all the news of the neighborhood. His other cute quirks include being a verryyyy deep sleeper with vivid dreams leading to twitching and the occasional talking! He enjoys watching other dogs on his walks and wants to make friends. He accepts baths but not blowdryers! He loves to cuddle and will paw you or give a cute seal sound if you stop petting him. He loves food puzzles and chewing his bully sticks too. Wherever you are in the house, he will come lay near you and keep you company.\r\n\r\nMy Borough breaker writes: I had the pleasure of taking Sky Dragon on a day trip. He was an absolute joy. We explored the beautiful landscapes of Central Park, from the Harlem Meer to the Conservatory Gardens. He was fascinated by the fountains, so much so that he got excited and tried to jump right in!\r\nOne of Sky Dragon's best qualities is his lovely, calm demeanor around distractions. He wasn't super reactive to the birds, squirrels, or even small dogs we passed, which made for a very pleasant and manageable walk.\r\nSky Dragon is a very treat-motivated boy. As I saw noted in his profile, he can get a little overzealous and nip when taking treats, but it's clear he means no harm. He does follow commands, but seems a little less likely to follow them if there is not a treat involved! So treats are a must!\r\nI think he may have been a bit cautious about me at first, but after a few hours, he really started to come out of his shell and even trusted me enough to let me clean his face a bit.\r\nHe's an excellent communicator when it comes to his needs. During our walk, he let me know he wanted to take a break, so I took him inside thinking he was done. It turned out he just wanted a brief pause! He quickly asked to go back out, showing me that he simply prefers to take his adventures at his own pace with frequent, short breaks. He also has bursts of energy, like a little dragon taking flight, and I think he would make a fantastic jogging partner for an active person.\r\nSky Dragon was also the perfect brunch companion, sitting politely at my feet and enjoying the ambiance. He also knows he needs to stay hydrated! I was glad I had a backup water bottle, as he drinks frequently on his adventures, he went through 2 bottles on our first hour walk.",

She most definitely turns alot of heads when she's on a walk. In the beginning, she's a bit pulley on the leash, very energetic but that's because she is excited to just even be out. Took her to a nearby pet store & she grabbed a squeaky toy & ofcourse picked out her own treats. We came to a playground that just so happened to be empty & fenced with 1 entrance/exit & I let her roam freely! Huskies are known to want freedom to just run around & let off so much energy & Snowboard did just that! She was as free as the wind. She's very polite when taking a treat just as much as she is motivated to get one when asking her to do basic commands. On the way back, we encountered some pups & she was reactive, but if you continue to walk with her she will follow. Nonreactive to people walking by unless they want to pet her, she becomes the sweetest! Also, her leash manners become soft & she doesn't pull at all. If you're looking to win her over, give her some scratches near the tail & belly rubs, she will melt to the floor & you'll see just how vulnerable she is!\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>I'm ready to learn!

She most definitely turns alot of heads when she's on a walk. In the beginning, she's a bit pulley on the leash, very energetic but that's because she is excited to just even be out. Took her to a nearby pet store & she grabbed a squeaky toy & ofcourse picked out her own treats. We came to a playground that just so happened to be empty & fenced with 1 entrance/exit & I let her roam freely! Huskies are known to want freedom to just run around & let off so much energy & Snowboard did just that! She was as free as the wind. She's very polite when taking a treat just as much as she is motivated to get one when asking her to do basic commands. On the way back, we encountered some pups & she was reactive, but if you continue to walk with her she will follow. Nonreactive to people walking by unless they want to pet her, she becomes the sweetest! Also, her leash manners become soft & she doesn't pull at all. If you're looking to win her over, give her some scratches near the tail & belly rubs, she will melt to the floor & you'll see just how vulnerable she is!\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>I'm ready to learn! I need a patient person who has the time to work on training with me.</p>\r\n<p>I need a home without cats or small animals.</p>\r\n<p>Not only do I pull at heart strings, but I also pull on leash!

      "summaryHtml": "My foster writes: The first thing you need to know is that Stella snores. This is relevant because she will be on or near you whenever she or both of you are asleep. She is a snuggler and shameless lap dog (ahem, please note her size). She loves to play with her foster mom, spend time in the park, and tear into her toys (those magnificent ones with the squeaking ball inside!). She is working on her leash manners and is a sweet student. Her potty habits are excellent. She sports a rain coat when skies are gray and a lovely scarf when the sun shines...puppy pearls are in her future. If you need a true friend and love bug in your life, she is a lovely sidekick for any and every adventure!\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf1f Meet Stella!\r\nOwner Surrender - Found as a Stray, Cared for by a Good Samaritan\r\n\r\nStella is a 4-year-old sweetheart with a calm presence and an affectionate soul. After being found wandering near a playground, she was taken in by a kind neighbor who hoped to find her family-but when no one came forward and medical care became too expensive, Stella was lovingly surrendered to ACC for a second chance. Now this mellow, loving pup is looking for her forever home.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udfe1 My Ideal Home\r\nStella would be a wonderful match for someone seeking a relaxed, loyal companion. She's easy to walk, tolerant of new experiences, and happiest when lounging by your side or getting gentle pets. A home where she can continue healing and be treated like the cherished family member she is would be ideal.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc76 Good with Kids?\r\nYes! Stella previously lived with children and was described as tolerant and friendly. Her easygoing nature makes her a great match for families with respectful kids.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc15 Good with Other Dogs?\r\nStella has not lived with other dogs, but she's been neutral and polite during greetings at the shelter. She could be a good fit with a calm, compatible canine companion after a slow introduction.\r\n\r\n\ud83e\uddae Leash Manners\r\nStella walks well on leash, occasionally pulling toward interesting smells but never unruly. She's a breeze to take on strolls and checks in sweetly with her handler along the way.\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udde0 Behavior Determination: Level 1\r\nStella is a gentle, social, easygoing dog who seeks out human affection and calmly navigates new environments. She's tolerant, housetrained, and unbothered by handling-even when startled or restrained.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf89 One Fun Fact\r\nShe loves Milk-Bone MaroSnacks and baby talk-and she'll gently lean into you for more when the treats are gone!\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcb8 Adoption Fee: Sponsored!\r\nThanks to ACC staff member Erica, Stella's adoption fee has been fully covered-all she needs now is your heart and home.",

This affectionate sweetheart loves nothing more than being near her people-whether that's joining in on your daily adventures or curling up beside you for some well-earned relaxation.\r\n\r\nStormi is a social, loving dog who enjoys being part of the action. You'll usually find her hanging out in the living room or wherever the family is gathered, happily soaking up all the attention she can get.\r\n\r\nShe's a dream when it comes to grooming-baths, brushing, even nail trims are no problem for this easygoing girl. Stormi walks beautifully on leash with very little pulling, and she's already mastered all her basic cues. She also loves car rides and is always ready to hop in for a fun outing!\r\n\r\nStormi's perfect home will be one where she can be the center of attention-she needs to be the only dog in the household. In return, she'll fill your life with love, laughter, and endless cuddles. \ud83d\udc95\r\n\r\nMy boroughbreaker writes: Stormi jumped right in my car with her tail wagging so happily. We went back to my house. I took her for a walk in the neighborhood. She enjoyed smelling and looking all around. She has very good leash manners and was a pleasure to walk with her. When we got in the house she was so excited to explore her new surroundings. She was very happy to meet members of my family. She's such a sweetheart. She enjoyed being scratched and hugged , she loved when I massaged her neck and head. She wanted to be close to me & snuggle up on the couch. Shes a sweetie of a dog.\r\n\r\nMy boroughbreaker writes: Stormi was an overall great dog, it was so sad to have to bring her back. Stormi is an absolute delight! I took her out on a borough break today, and while she started off excited in the new environment-pulling a bit and not too interested in treats-she quickly showed her true colors once she felt safe and settled. This beautiful, strong little chunky monkey absolutely shines in a calm, low-traffic area.\r\nOnce she relaxed, she took treats gently, walked like a dream, and covered me in the sweetest kisses. She was so grateful just to be outside and enjoy the world with someone by her side.\r\nStormi would thrive with someone who enjoys walking or running in quieter spaces. She's a fun, loving girl and I 100% recommend taking her out for a break-or even better, bringing her home as a foster. She's a chunky couch potato who just wants to be loved!",

      "description_html": "\ud83c\udf29\ufe0f Meet Stormi! \ud83c\udf29\ufe0f\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a loyal best friend who's equal parts playful companion and snuggly couch buddy, Stormi is your girl! This affectionate sweetheart loves nothing more than being near her people-whether that's joining in on your daily adventures or curling up beside you for some well-earned relaxation.\r\n\r\nStormi is a social, loving dog who enjoys being part of the action. You'll usually find her hanging out in the living room or wherever the family is gathered, happily soaking up all the attention she can get.\r\n\r\nShe's a dream when it comes to grooming-baths, brushing, even nail trims are no problem for this easygoing girl. Stormi walks beautifully on leash with very little pulling, and she's already mastered all her basic cues. She also loves car rides and is always ready to hop in for a fun outing!\r\n\r\nStormi's perfect home will be one where she can be the center of attention-she needs to be the only dog in the household. In return, she'll fill your life with love, laughter, and endless cuddles. \ud83d\udc95\r\n\r\nMy boroughbreaker writes: Stormi jumped right in my car with her tail wagging so happily. We went back to my house. I took her for a walk in the neighborhood. She enjoyed smelling and looking all around. She has very good leash manners and was a pleasure to walk with her. When we got in the house she was so excited to explore her new surroundings. She was very happy to meet members of my family. She's such a sweetheart. She enjoyed being scratched and hugged , she loved when I massaged her neck and head. She wanted to be close to me & snuggle up on the couch. Shes a sweetie of a dog.\r\n\r\nMy boroughbreaker writes: Stormi was an overall great dog, it was so sad to have to bring her back. Stormi is an absolute delight! I took her out on a borough break today, and while she started off excited in the new environment-pulling a bit and not too interested in treats-she quickly showed her true colors once she felt safe and settled. This beautiful, strong little chunky monkey absolutely shines in a calm, low-traffic area.\r\nOnce she relaxed, she took treats gently, walked like a dream, and covered me in the sweetest kisses. She was so grateful just to be outside and enjoy the world with someone by her side.\r\nStormi would thrive with someone who enjoys walking or running in quieter spaces. She's a fun, loving girl and I 100% recommend taking her out for a break-or even better, bringing her home as a foster. She's a chunky couch potato who just wants to be loved!",

I'll need extra help from you.</p>\r\n<p>I will flourish in a calm environment and a low-traffic home.</p>\r\n\r\nMy Straycation Buddy Writes: Sumo brought so much joy to our home during the 3 days he was with us. He might be 8 years old, but has lovely energy; a \"play hard - nap hard\" kind of guy. He excels at fetch, outdoors and indoors, and never fails to cause a smile when he brings you a stuffed toy, or walks up and bumps you with his snout for a pet - especially during a boring conference call! He *loves* to cuddle & be close to his people, and got lots of passersby smiles when he lay down on a bench next to me, with his head in my lap. We also had the best nap together during my sick day! He's velvety soft to touch; instant relaxation.\r\nDuring the initial hours, he was quite pully apparently due to the novelty of the situation and stress, but by the next day walked on a loose leash or only mildly pulling. After initial adjustment, he is easy to walk. It helps that he's non-reactive: joggers, dogs, giant NYC rats don't faze him. (He is fully housetrained, too!) My favorite memory is relaxing together on a quiet stretch of the waterfront, with Sumo air scenting and watching the waves. His apple cronchies give me ASMR. Sumo also enjoys Greek yogurt, peanut butter, scrambled eggs, and... beets! He doesn't love new foods right away, but will give a few sniffs and tries, and sometimes it's a yes. He also likes to play \"carwash\", when he wiggles between your legs while you rub his sides!\r\n\r\nMy boroughbreaker writes: I had such a fun day taking Sumo out on a borough break! He is such an all-around good boy with so much sweetness and energy. On our first walk, he pulled on the leash pretty strongly due to his excitement, but he never flinched walking by people or other dogs. He received so many smiles from people passing by, and his cutie ears (one up, one down) are absolutely adorable.\r\nHe's a very energetic boy and had lots of zoomies when he first came into our apartment, but with enough time and patience, I think he'll quickly become more at ease in a new space, he just needs a little time to adjust! By our second walk, you could already tell he felt more comfortable: he walked slower, pulled less, and kept looking back at me to make sure I was enjoying the walk too!\r\nHe's great with general commands like \"sit,\" \"down,\" \"stay,\" \"wait,\" and \"leave it.\" He takes treats gently from your hand and loves rolling over to show off his big belly. He enjoys sitting in the sun and will hop right into your lap looking for cuddles or rest his head in your lap.\r\nI think he would do well in a calm, larger home where he has plenty of space to explore and play. He's incredibly sweet-natured and has so much love to give!",

I'll need extra help from you.</p>\r\n<p>I will flourish in a calm environment and a low-traffic home.</p>\r\n\r\nMy Straycation Buddy Writes: Sumo brought so much joy to our home during the 3 days he was with us. He might be 8 years old, but has lovely energy; a \"play hard - nap hard\" kind of guy. He excels at fetch, outdoors and indoors, and never fails to cause a smile when he brings you a stuffed toy, or walks up and bumps you with his snout for a pet - especially during a boring conference call! He *loves* to cuddle & be close to his people, and got lots of passersby smiles when he lay down on a bench next to me, with his head in my lap. We also had the best nap together during my sick day! He's velvety soft to touch; instant relaxation.\r\nDuring the initial hours, he was quite pully apparently due to the novelty of the situation and stress, but by the next day walked on a loose leash or only mildly pulling. After initial adjustment, he is easy to walk. It helps that he's non-reactive: joggers, dogs, giant NYC rats don't faze him. (He is fully housetrained, too!) My favorite memory is relaxing together on a quiet stretch of the waterfront, with Sumo air scenting and watching the waves. His apple cronchies give me ASMR. Sumo also enjoys Greek yogurt, peanut butter, scrambled eggs, and... beets! He doesn't love new foods right away, but will give a few sniffs and tries, and sometimes it's a yes. He also likes to play \"carwash\", when he wiggles between your legs while you rub his sides!\r\n\r\nMy boroughbreaker writes: I had such a fun day taking Sumo out on a borough break! He is such an all-around good boy with so much sweetness and energy. On our first walk, he pulled on the leash pretty strongly due to his excitement, but he never flinched walking by people or other dogs. He received so many smiles from people passing by, and his cutie ears (one up, one down) are absolutely adorable.\r\nHe's a very energetic boy and had lots of zoomies when he first came into our apartment, but with enough time and patience, I think he'll quickly become more at ease in a new space, he just needs a little time to adjust! By our second walk, you could already tell he felt more comfortable: he walked slower, pulled less, and kept looking back at me to make sure I was enjoying the walk too!\r\nHe's great with general commands like \"sit,\" \"down,\" \"stay,\" \"wait,\" and \"leave it.\" He takes treats gently from your hand and loves rolling over to show off his big belly. He enjoys sitting in the sun and will hop right into your lap looking for cuddles or rest his head in your lap.\r\nI think he would do well in a calm, larger home where he has plenty of space to explore and play. He's incredibly sweet-natured and has so much love to give!",

Friendly, outgoing, and always ready for fun, Titan is the kind of dog who makes everyone feel like his best friend.\r\n\r\nHe absolutely loves treats and attention, and his goofy, affectionate nature makes him a favorite with everyone who spends time with him. Whether he's out on a walk, seeking attention, or just hanging out by your side, Titan brings pure happiness wherever he goes.\r\n\r\nWhen Titan first arrived at the shelter, he was very underweight - but thanks to great care and a strong spirit, he's bounced back and is now feeling strong, healthy, and ready for his forever home.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a dog who will make you smile every day and shower you with love, Titan is your guy. Come meet him and see just how special he'll make you feel.\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy Writes: \r\nDear Santa Paws\r\nThis year, I don't want toys or treats. All I want for Christmas is a family to call my own. I've been a very good dog, and I promise to be the best boy ever if you can help me find my forever home. I dream of a warm place to snuggle and a loving person to share my days with. Please send my person to find me so I can leave this shelter behind and start my new life with them. Thank you, Santa Paws \ud83d\udc3e \ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\r\nLove Titan\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy Writes: Titan was so excited to see me. I took him on 3 BoroughBreaks already. He couldn't wait to jump in my car and go back to my house. He is very good in the car ride. He likes to ride in the passenger seat and look out the window.\r\nTitan is such a sweet and gentle loving dog. He likes to lay right next to me on the couch and rest his head on me. He especially loves Costco rotisserie chicken. I make sure I always have it for him.\r\nHe is also playful, he loves to run around and interact with me.\r\nHe understands when I tell him no!\r\nTitan will make a great addition to your home with his lovable sweet personality. You can't help not falling in love with him.",

Friendly, outgoing, and always ready for fun, Titan is the kind of dog who makes everyone feel like his best friend.\r\n\r\nHe absolutely loves treats and attention, and his goofy, affectionate nature makes him a favorite with everyone who spends time with him. Whether he's out on a walk, seeking attention, or just hanging out by your side, Titan brings pure happiness wherever he goes.\r\n\r\nWhen Titan first arrived at the shelter, he was very underweight - but thanks to great care and a strong spirit, he's bounced back and is now feeling strong, healthy, and ready for his forever home.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a dog who will make you smile every day and shower you with love, Titan is your guy. Come meet him and see just how special he'll make you feel.\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy Writes: \r\nDear Santa Paws\r\nThis year, I don't want toys or treats. All I want for Christmas is a family to call my own. I've been a very good dog, and I promise to be the best boy ever if you can help me find my forever home. I dream of a warm place to snuggle and a loving person to share my days with. Please send my person to find me so I can leave this shelter behind and start my new life with them. Thank you, Santa Paws \ud83d\udc3e \ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\r\nLove Titan\r\n\r\nMy #BoroughBreak Buddy Writes: Titan was so excited to see me. I took him on 3 BoroughBreaks already. He couldn't wait to jump in my car and go back to my house. He is very good in the car ride. He likes to ride in the passenger seat and look out the window.\r\nTitan is such a sweet and gentle loving dog. He likes to lay right next to me on the couch and rest his head on me. He especially loves Costco rotisserie chicken. I make sure I always have it for him.\r\nHe is also playful, he loves to run around and interact with me.\r\nHe understands when I tell him no!\r\nTitan will make a great addition to your home with his lovable sweet personality. You can't help not falling in love with him.",

In addition to being the sweetest and most loving pup, and she knows how to be patient with people who want to give her attention and with me when I'm preparing her food. The only thing she is not patient about it is when she sees there's a chance that we might be heading toward the park. Then the excited puppy energy takes over.\r\nVelvet loves tennis balls, soccer balls, squeaky toys (she is a very efficient squeaker-remover), fetch, and tug of war. Her tail is powerful and she wags it with gusto when she is happy.\r\nVelvet loves to run but she is also happy as a work-from-companion, having attended many zoom meetings with me and listened in on countless work phone calls. She lounges about during the day for a surprising number of hours. She cuddles me at night (yes, of course, she sleeps in my bed and gets her hair everywhere), and sometimes snores (it's adorable), and has little dreams where she is apparently paddling her paws in a wide ocean or something like that.\r\nVelvet is not a picky eater and takes her meds in half-vienna-sausages with no problems at all. I've only been in two ubers with her and no city buses, but she is making great strides with the subway where she is peaceful and patient and never tires of the public attention her brindle coat guarantees.\r\nShe knows perhaps 20 commands and we're working on \"privacy\" (so a human can use the bathroom in peace) and \"slow\" when going down stairs.\r\nI love her a lot. She has quickly become my best friend. I am sure you will love her, too.\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>I'm ready to learn! I need a patient person who has the time to work on training with me.</p>\r\n<p>I would appreciate slow introductions to new people and places to help me feel safe.</p>\r\n<p>I love getting pets and - you guessed it - snuggles!</p>\r\n<p>I will need daily physical activity to keep me healthy and happy!</p>",

In addition to being the sweetest and most loving pup, and she knows how to be patient with people who want to give her attention and with me when I'm preparing her food. The only thing she is not patient about it is when she sees there's a chance that we might be heading toward the park. Then the excited puppy energy takes over.\r\nVelvet loves tennis balls, soccer balls, squeaky toys (she is a very efficient squeaker-remover), fetch, and tug of war. Her tail is powerful and she wags it with gusto when she is happy.\r\nVelvet loves to run but she is also happy as a work-from-companion, having attended many zoom meetings with me and listened in on countless work phone calls. She lounges about during the day for a surprising number of hours. She cuddles me at night (yes, of course, she sleeps in my bed and gets her hair everywhere), and sometimes snores (it's adorable), and has little dreams where she is apparently paddling her paws in a wide ocean or something like that.\r\nVelvet is not a picky eater and takes her meds in half-vienna-sausages with no problems at all. I've only been in two ubers with her and no city buses, but she is making great strides with the subway where she is peaceful and patient and never tires of the public attention her brindle coat guarantees.\r\nShe knows perhaps 20 commands and we're working on \"privacy\" (so a human can use the bathroom in peace) and \"slow\" when going down stairs.\r\nI love her a lot. She has quickly become my best friend. I am sure you will love her, too.\r\n\r\n<p>What my friends at ACC say about me:</p>\r\n<p>I'm ready to learn! I need a patient person who has the time to work on training with me.</p>\r\n<p>I would appreciate slow introductions to new people and places to help me feel safe.</p>\r\n<p>I love getting pets and - you guessed it - snuggles!</p>\r\n<p>I will need daily physical activity to keep me healthy and happy!</p>",

Please click here to go to our emergency placement page for more information.</a></b><br /><br />\r\n\r\nXena is at risk for behavior reasons. Xena was initially highly fearful entering the shelter but is warming up towards staff. Despite her being more social, she has begun leash biting exiting her kennel. Xena has a bite to the other resident dog and has shown barrier frustration when other dogs pass her kennel. She should be the only pet in an adult only home. Medically, she has some dental disease but is an otherwise healthy dog. \r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc51 Meet Xena \ud83d\udc51\r\n\r\nXena is highly fearful in the care center, currently allowing only minimal handling. The shelter environment is overwhelming for her, which means she will require a slow, structured decompression period and gradual introductions to new people once adopted. Her fearfulness in the shelter may not reflect who she will be in a stable, loving home, but it does mean she needs an adopter who is patient, gentle, and committed to moving at her pace.\r\n\r\nWith consistency, time, and a quiet household, Xena has every potential to regain her confidence and show the affectionate, playful, and devoted dog she has always been. She will thrive with someone who understands her sensitivities and is ready to give her the supportive, understanding home she deserves.\r\n\r\nHer owner describes her as a loving, social, and affectionate dog who truly thrives in a calm home environment. She is very active and playful, enjoys being wherever her people are, and has a history of being gentle, clean, and closely bonded with her family. At home, she loved bath time and water, allowed brushing and nail trims, walked 1-2 times daily with mild to moderate pulling, and was comfortable spending time in her large crate. She also knows \"Sit,\" enjoys car rides, and loves her hard bone and rope toys.\r\n\r\nIt is important for future adopters to know that Xena must be the only pet in the home. She will do best without other animals, allowing her to feel secure and receive the focused support she needs.",

      "summaryHtml": "Zam is an enthusiastic and intelligent dog enrolled in our Shelter Scholars program, where he's learning to stay grounded during walks by working on on-leash reactivity. With patience and practice, he's beginning to replace reactive behaviors with calm focus and improved leash manners, turning daily outings into opportunities for growth.\r\n\r\nMeet Zam!\r\nOwner surrender with prior ACC history; his family could no longer provide the time and housing he needs. In care, he's shown both a sweet, people-focused side and some stress in busy kennel areas.\r\n\r\nMy Ideal Home\r\nExperienced, adult-only adopters who can offer structure, a calm routine, and positive-reinforcement training. Decompression time, enrichment (sniff walks, food puzzles, long-lasting chews), and clear guidance will help him feel safe and settle in.\r\n\r\nGood with Kids?\r\nRecommended no children under 13 due to fearfulness and sensitivity to handling.\r\n\r\nGood with Other Pets?\r\nRecommended single-pet home. In shelter play/near-dog settings he's shown tension, barking, and fixating; we also recommend no dog parks.\r\n\r\nLeash Manners\r\nLeashes easily and can walk with light to moderate tension, but may pull hard and vocalize when he sees other dogs. Use distance, \"look at me/let's go\" games, and a front-clip harness to support success. Redirect to treats or a sniff break before he escalates.\r\n\r\nOverall Health\r\nVeterinary exam lists him as apparently healthy; heartworm tests have been negative. He is neutered and up to date on core vaccines. A dental cleaning (COHAT) is recommended at adoption.\r\n\r\nBehavior Determination & Other\r\nLevel 3. Recommendations: adult-only home; single pet; no dog parks. Potential challenges noted: fearful in new situations, on-leash reactivity/barrier frustration, occasional leash mouthing under stress. Training focus: slow, choice-based introductions, reward check-ins, and consistent management around other dogs.\r\n\r\nFun Facts\r\n\u2022 Housetrained\r\n\u2022 Knows sit, stay, shake/paw\r\n\u2022 Food-motivated and enjoys snuffle mats/puzzles\r\n\u2022 Loves car rides and playing with balls\r\n",

Zazu is an easy going, well behaved pup that would be ideal for any family, even new dog owners! She is very gentle and doesn't jump, making her a wonderful family pup for kids. I truly can't believe she hasn't found her forever home yet. \r\n\r\nBonus: She is estimated to be 7yrs but this spring chicken recently had a full glow up at the vet and came back with a clean bill of health!\r\n\r\nMeet Zazu - Your New Cuddle Companion!\r\nZazu was brought to us by officers at the 116th precinct after she was found abandoned in Queens. Despite her rough start, Zazu has been nothing but gentle, wiggly, and ready for love.\r\n\r\nMy ideal home:\r\nZazu is a senior sweetheart looking for a calm, loving home where she can snooze in sunny spots, enjoy leisurely strolls, and be spoiled with affection. \r\n\r\nGood with Kids?\r\nZazu is gentle, social, and tolerant of handling-traits that could make her a great match for a family with respectful kids. As always, a meet-and-greet is recommended.\r\n\r\nGood with other dogs?\r\nZazu has shown mixed responses with other dogs in shelter playgroups and seems more comfortable avoiding confrontation. A solo-pet household or slow introductions at home would be best.\r\n\r\nLeash Manners:\r\nShe walks politely with minimal pulling and happily follows her handler's lead. Just bring the leash and some treats-Zazu's ready to go!",
