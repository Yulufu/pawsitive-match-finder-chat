      "description": "Cherie, Cherie baby! Cherie, can you come out tonight? \n\nSweet Cherie is looking for a family and she knows that you're thinking, \"I'm gonna make-a you mineee!\"  She's a young and active staffie mix looking to be your one and only pup. She's super affectionate, big on hugs, and absolutely loves bringing her toys with her everywhere she goes.\n\nA good Samaritan saw this poor girl being abandoned and immediately scooped her up out of harm's way. She's now safe and sound at Animal Haven and waiting for another chance to love again. \n\nCherie has been in a few fosters during her time at Animal Haven and has done amazing on all of her outings away from the shelter.\n\nHere are some notes from her last foster: \nCherie is a sweet and well-behaved girl in a home, especially once she has a few days to settle into a new routine - she was accident free in just a few days! She's respectful of human belongings, both when you're home and when you're not.  She's affectionate, cuddly, and loves being right by your side whenever you're home! Cherie is a young and active girl who loves to play, but settles in her bed or on the couch when you leave and will wait for you to get home. \n\nCherie gets incredibly excited for walks - she's ready to go whenever! Her toys are great to keep her focused and helps keep her energy directed where it needs to be. She has come a long way since she's been with us, but is still working on her leash manners. She doesn't like to say hi to other dogs, but as long as they don't bark at her, she's been learning to mind her own business.\n\nShe is a sweet and active companion and also a good jogging partner! She'll appreciate it as she has lots of energy! Cherie will likely never be a dog park kind of dog, although she has played with some other dogs in the past, she can be a lot for other dogs if they can't match her energy.\n\nCherie is hoping she'll be able to find a new family of her very own and we know there's someone out there looking for an active, smart-cookie like her! Come meet Cherie at Animal Haven!",

These guys are all wrinkles and love, and can either be adopted together or separately (after some time with us, they don\u2019t seem to be bonded).\n\nThese two were surrendered to us after being in a home all their lives. They\u2019re adjusting and showing us their charming, snuffly Bulldog personalities. Don\u2019t let their age deter you\u2014these bullies still have a lot of love left in \u2018em! They do a whole lot of nothing most of the day, so they might be a couch potato\u2019s dream dog. But Bulldog people know this breed has a whole lot of other things to deal with. From crusty skin folds and dry eyes to allergies and breathing difficulties, expect them to need a little extra care to make up for their lower energy requirements! That said, these two are in pretty good shape, all things considered. \n\nAdopt Bruno!",

This sweet shepherd mix was likely used for breeding\u2014she was seen in a home with a male dog before being abandoned in a nearby parking lot, extremely skinny, anxious, and with signs of having recently given birth. A Good Samaritan found her and tried to return her to the suspected owners, but they refused to answer the door. \n\nWhen Gina arrived at Animal Haven, it quickly became clear that something was different about her: She would begin spinning in circles, sometimes snapping at the air in the process. Initially, we thought this might be a neurological problem and consulted with a specialist to conduct an MRI and spinal tap, but the results did not reveal any neurological or medical issues. We then consulted with a veterinary behaviorist, who suspects that Gina\u2019s spinning episodes are caused primarily by environmental triggers. \n\nGina now has a long-term plan to help reduce her stress, manage her environment, and provide her with enrichment and decompression time to hopefully reduce her spinning and air-snapping episodes, but this will be a journey. Her adopter will need to be willing to work with Gina and our trainers to manage her environment and continue her regimen. \n\nWhile Gina is definitely a project who will do best with an experienced adopter, we can say with certainty that she is a total sweetheart! She\u2019s snuggly, playful, and responsive to treats and toys. Her episodes typically happen when she is loose in a space, whether her kennel or one of our training rooms, and she can be \u201csnapped out\u201d of them fairly easily. Animal Haven will of course provide ongoing support to help Gina transition and settle into her new home and life. Reach out to our team if you\u2019re interested in meeting Gina and learning more about this darling pup!",

      "description": "Poor Douglas was found on the side of a road in Antigua, dragging his hind legs. Although his rescuers initially thought he had been hit by a car, upon further inspection his injuries were actually fairly old. They believe that he was likely attacked by other dogs on the island, leaving him with partial paralysis in his hindquarters.\n\nThanks to the amazing Dogs and Cats of Antigua, Douglas has made his way up to Animal Haven where his new life begins. We are so thankful to have the opportunity to give this sweet boy the chance at life he otherwise would not have had.\n\nRight now we are still learning more about Douglas's current condition and we don't have a lot of answers just yet. We are sending him to our partner vets for spinal x-rays and a neurological consultation to get a better idea of the extent of his paralysis. Once we have more information, we'll be able to determine if he's a candidate for corrective surgery or wheelchair! We'll keep you all updated along his journey but he is available for adoption right now! Animal Haven will of course be covering the costs of his diagnostics and treatments and we're hopeful Douglas will charm his way into someone's heart soon.\n\nIn addition to his paralysis, Douglas is also suffering from heartworm, ehrlichia, a urinary tract infection, and open lesions on his legs - we know, he's got a LOT going on.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about Douglas or are interested in adopting him, please contact Animal Haven to get in touch with a staff member directly.",

It's hard to say what his life was before he was found, but he's clearly been through a lot. He was completely shut down when he first arrived at Animal Haven - he trembled in the corner and wouldn\u2019t even take treats tossed near him. But our dedicated staff have been working with him every day to earn his trust and we\u2019re so happy to report that their work has clearly paid off.\n\nMario has become fast friends with many of our staff and volunteers and has really come out of his shell, but he will need a patient and understanding family who\u2019s willing to work at his pace to build his confidence and set him up for success. He is still a little bit nervous on walks if there is a lot of foot traffic, so he would likely do best in a quieter neighborhood. Mario has shown no aggression during his time with us, favoring avoidance if he\u2019s ever uncomfortable in any situation. Overall, he is a gentle soul who just needs a little extra time to settle in to a new space.\n\nHe\u2019s a big guy, but tries to be small whenever he can. We know this sweet boy has a big heart to match and will make an amazing companion for someone willing to put in a little time for him. Interested in Mario? We encourage you to submit an inquiry through his profile prior to visiting him to make sure Mario\u2019s best friends can make his introductions. Adopt Mario!",

      "description": "Monte lives with a condition called Megaesophagus. This condition varies in severity on a case by case basis with all dogs and we look to our vets directly on recommendations for his care. Essentially, Monte's esophagus is enlarged and doesn't function correctly to help keep his food down. Monte must sit in a special chair that keeps him upright in order to prevent him from regurgitating his food and he needs to stay upright after feedings for 10-15 minutes to ensure the food safely reaches his stomach. Monte has his own custom \"Bailey Chair\" and uses it like an absolute pro - he hops right into it when it's meal time! His chair will come with him when he's adopted!\n\nMonte is a gleeful, playful dog who otherwise lives a normal life. He LOVES toys and enjoys his \"party time\" in our training room where he runs out his zoomies. Although his condition prevents us from using treats to train, he's highly toy motivated and has been picking up basics like a pro! We've also been utilizing special treats just for dogs with his condition which he loves! Potential adopters will need to be aware that Monte is on a special diet for his condition and currently has 3 meal times a day. If he accidentally ingests anything between those mealtimes, he will need to sit in his chair. He's a big boy that will need consistent, unique training and supervision while he works on his impulse control!\n\nUnfortunately, Monte has spent the majority of his life in a shelter environment during the pandemic, Monte is a little behind in his socialization. He can be unsure about meeting new people and will bark at things he is apprehensive about. He is great with those who he has been properly introduced to though and good introductions will be key! Monte would likely do best in a quieter neighborhood out of Manhattan, away from any enticing sidewalk snacks he shouldn't get into and scary skateboarders. \n\nIf you're interested in finding out more about Monte and his condition, please contact Animal Haven!",

These little ones survived thanks to the compassion of a local woman who wouldn't give up on them.\n\nWhen their mama showed up and gave birth near the woman\u2019s food stand, she kept a close eye on the pups. Mama eventually retreated into the brush to give birth to her last puppy, Tainy, but the woman didn\u2019t know at the time if mama would return. With darkness approaching, the woman didn\u2019t want to leave the puppies alone\u2014so she took them in, keeping them beside her day and night. While she ran her food stand by day, the woman was a cab driver at night. And guess who came along? The woman lovingly bottle fed each of the puppies in between fares, making sure they received enough nutrition to continue growing big and strong.\n\nEventually, mama returned to the food stand with Tainy to reunite with the rest of her pups. The woman took the whole little family in to keep them safe, and we welcomed these survivors to NYC. Now, they\u2019re ready to find homes!",

Her treatment has stretched over months, during which time she\u2019s had to remain as calm as possible. \n\nEven worse, when our veterinary team took x-rays of Harmony\u2019s heart, they found her neck and chest to be riddled with BB pellets. Someone had shot at this sweet, gentle mama. \n\nThat's all behind her now, and we're now rewriting Harmony\u2019s story\u2014helping her heal and ultimately find the loving home she so deserves. Harmony is currently in a foster home, where she's staying calm during heartworm treatment and recovery. Reach out to schedule a meet and greet with this incredibly sweet girl!",
