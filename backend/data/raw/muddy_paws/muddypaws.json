      "description": "Relish is a sweet, sensitive boy with a big heart who's still learning that the world isn\u2019t such a scary place.  Unfamiliar people and loud noises make him nervous\u2014but don\u2019t let that fool you. Beneath that cautious exterior is a playful, loving, affectionate dog just waiting to shine.\nHe\u2019s making steady progress in building his confidence every day and just needs someone willing to let him go at his own pace.. What helps most? Other dogs! Relish adores canine companions and really comes alive when around doggie friends. He gains so much comfort and courage from having a friendly dog by his side. He also lights up during a game of fetch\u2014it\u2019s his favorite way to bond and burn off energy.\nRelish would do best in a calm, patient home with people who understand that trust takes time.\nIf you\u2019re the kind of person who believes in giving shy dogs a chance to blossom, Relish is ready to reward your patience with a lifetime of love and loyalty.\n\n\ufeffRelish is approximately 1y 2m 9d old and is fully grown at 44 pounds. They are microchipped and up to date on all age-appropriate medical care. Their breed is unknown as we have not had a DNA test done.\n\nAlthough our dogs are listed as unknown breed, buildings with specific dog restrictions typically enforce their rules based on what breeds a dog appears to resemble. It's always important to keep that in mind and know your building's policies before adopting a dog.\n\nThis dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue. If you're interested in adopting, the first thing you should do is begin the registration process at\u00a0www.muddypawsrescue.org. If you are already a registered adopter with Muddy Paws Rescue, please email us at\u00a0adoptionmeetings@muddypawsrescue.org.",

He loves to play with his toys and often comes to his foster mom to play with him.  He loves to play outside as well and is pretty good on a leash. He is housebroken, standing by the door when he wants to go out and is trustworthy in the house. He is slow to warm up to new people but with gentle coaxing and treats he is calm although a little standoffish. He loves belly rubs and cuddles. He has a strong prey drive, wanting to run after the squirrels in the neighborhood.  He\u2019s fun to be with and happy when his foster mom comes home. He does well at being alone and we have left him for 8 hours!\n\n\ufeffPippin is approximately 1y 9m 19d old and is fully grown at 39 pounds. They are microchipped and up to date on all age-appropriate medical care. Their breed is unknown as we have not had a DNA test done.\n\nAlthough our dogs are listed as unknown breed, buildings with specific dog restrictions typically enforce their rules based on what breeds a dog appears to resemble. It's always important to keep that in mind and know your building's policies before adopting a dog.\n\nThis dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue. If you're interested in adopting, the first thing you should do is begin the registration process at\u00a0www.muddypawsrescue.org. If you are already a registered adopter with Muddy Paws Rescue, please email us at\u00a0adoptionmeetings@muddypawsrescue.org.",

Affectionately known as \"Bam\", this lovable boy is cuddly, playful, and full of love for both people and other dogs. Bam Bam loves to cuddle (he definitely thinks he\u2019s lap-sized), play tug, and sunbathe in the backyard. He\u2019s smart, eager to learn, and picks up new routines quickly. Bam loves other dogs and would absolutely love to live with one in his forever home.\n\n\ufeffBam Bam is approximately 5y 1m 12d old and is fully grown at 65 pounds. They are microchipped and up to date on all age-appropriate medical care. Their breed is unknown as we have not had a DNA test done.\n\nAlthough our dogs are listed as unknown breed, buildings with specific dog restrictions typically enforce their rules based on what breeds a dog appears to resemble. It's always important to keep that in mind and know your building's policies before adopting a dog.\n\nThis dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue. If you're interested in adopting, the first thing you should do is begin the registration process at\u00a0www.muddypawsrescue.org. If you are already a registered adopter with Muddy Paws Rescue, please email us at\u00a0adoptionmeetings@muddypawsrescue.org.",

I\u2019m spunky, curious, and full of personality. At 8 years young, I still have plenty of pep in my step for walks, outdoor exploring, and playtime with my favorite humans.\n\nI was born deaf, so I experience the world a little differently, but that doesn\u2019t slow me down one bit. I\u2019m learning sign language (how cool is that?!) and doing great with it, though my foster mom is also teaching me touch signals. What helps me thrive is a calm, structured home with a predictable routine and people who understand that I feel safest when things are steady.\n\nI can get a bit anxious when there\u2019s too much change, but once I know what to expect, I settle right in and show my loving, loyal side. I adore being close to my people- whether it\u2019s curling up on the couch, joining a little adventure, or simply being your shadow.\n\nI\u2019m currently being fostered with both dogs and cats, and I get along beautifully with everyone. I\u2019ve also been around kids and am gentle and patient with them- especially when they offer belly rubs or treats!\n\nAnd here\u2019s a fun fact: after eight years apart, I was reunited with my birth sister in foster care!\n\nI may not hear when you call me a good girl, but I feel it in my heart every time you show me love. If you\u2019re looking for a gentle, affectionate companion who thrives on routine and will be your loyal best friend through it all, I think we might be the perfect match.\n\n\ufeffSugar is approximately 8y 2m 14d old and is fully grown at 35 pounds.

      "description": "Meet Snaggle! This sweet boy has been through so much, yet has so much love to give. Snaggle was found by the ASPCA after having been hit by a vehicle. Ever since, he's been working towards mastering life as a tripawd and settling into his foster home. Don't let his three legs or his age fool you; this boy is a great walker and full of life.\n\nSnaggle absolutely adores every human he has had the opportunity to meet. In fact, he loves nothing more than hanging out with his humans in any fashion -- following you around the house, cuddles on the couch, naps in the kennel while you work, or cozying up in a blanket for an episode or movie. This boy will be forever grateful to you (and will show it) for giving him a soft space to land.\n\n\ufeffSnaggle is approximately 10y 2m 12d old and is fully grown at 33 pounds. They are microchipped and up to date on all age-appropriate medical care. Their breed is unknown as we have not had a DNA test done.\n\nAlthough our dogs are listed as unknown breed, buildings with specific dog restrictions typically enforce their rules based on what breeds a dog appears to resemble. It's always important to keep that in mind and know your building's policies before adopting a dog.\n\nThis dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue. If you're interested in adopting, the first thing you should do is begin the registration process at\u00a0www.muddypawsrescue.org. If you are already a registered adopter with Muddy Paws Rescue, please email us at\u00a0adoptionmeetings@muddypawsrescue.org.",

He can open up given enough time and some furry friends who can show him how to dog. He is still fearful around people right now but has turned into a little cuddle bug with his foster mom and makes a little bit more progress each day. He takes awhile to warm up to new environments and likes to spend a lot of his time in his crate at first, but he'll slowly start exploring and engaging if given his own space to do so. He loves playing and engaging with other dogs (as long as they're close to his size), and he gains confidence from being able to mirror their behavior and learn how to interact with the world, so he would really love a sibling similar in size to himself.\n\nSwiper is still fearful of most humans and will run away or retreat to his crate if they try to pet him, speak to him, or make eye contact. However, over time he's gotten attached to his foster mom and proven that he can be very affectionate, cuddly, and loving with humans if interactions are slow and on his terms.\n\n\ufeffSwiper is approximately 1y 7m 7d old and is fully grown at 12 pounds. They are microchipped and up to date on all age-appropriate medical care. Their breed is unknown as we have not had a DNA test done.\n\nAlthough our dogs are listed as unknown breed, buildings with specific dog restrictions typically enforce their rules based on what breeds a dog appears to resemble.

Usually he will pee or poop overnight on the pad. Wake-up and breakfast around 8am, dinner around 6pm. He'll get 2-3 opportunities a day to the backyard for bathroom breaks, but the leash still stresses him out a bit so these aren't as frequent as they could/should be once he gets more comfortable. Most of the day is either hanging out in his crate or in a dog bed in foster mom's WFH office. Then after work time he'll spend hours cuddling on the couch. He doesn't do a ton of playing with toys or seem to enjoy enrichment toys much yet. He goes to bed around 11pm.",

He had been left for over 4 hours and done fine. However, we've noticed since about the time that foster mom became his safe person, he gets agitated and starts barking/whining when left alone, but specifically when foster mom has left the house entirely.

      "description": "Hi! I\u2019m Kilimanjaro, or Jaro for short! My foster mom tells me I\u2019m such a brave and excited puppy. I am learning new things every minute. Today I learned how to go up some of the steps in my foster house, but going down is trickier. I don\u2019t mind being carried though!\n\nI love to play with my foster brother and share his toys. I love having another dog to show me the ropes and be my walking buddy. I get really excited when I see other dogs on walks, but I think I just really want to say hi. \n\nI get sooo happy when my foster mom or dad walk into the room. I have so much love to give! My new favorite place is burrowing into the blankets on the couch. I like to be very snuggly and cuddled\n\nWhile I\u2019m still working on potty training, my foster mom says I\u2019ve improved so much already. Frequent trips outside are really helpful as I learn. \n\nI\u2019m so excited to meet you!\n\n\ufeffKilimanjaro is approximately 0y 5m 15d old and may be 45 to 65 pounds when fully grown. They are microchipped and up to date on all age-appropriate medical care. Their breed is unknown as we have not had a DNA test done.\n\nAlthough our dogs are listed as unknown breed, buildings with specific dog restrictions typically enforce their rules based on what breeds a dog appears to resemble. It's always important to keep that in mind and know your building's policies before adopting a dog.\n\nThis dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue. If you're interested in adopting, the first thing you should do is begin the registration process at\u00a0www.muddypawsrescue.org. If you are already a registered adopter with Muddy Paws Rescue, please email us at\u00a0adoptionmeetings@muddypawsrescue.org.",

      "description": "Meet Dolly, a gentle sweetheart who has slowly come out of her shell but is the most precious love bug! She\u2019s incredibly loving with people and has the sweetest personality once she feels safe and comfortable. She is very smart and totally trainable, she just wants to make her humans happy. Whether you have just gotten home from a few hours out or come back into the room from somewhere else in the house, she will shower you with love and excitement to see you!\n\nDolly is looking for a calm home where she can continue to gain confidence and adjust to her new surroundings. She took a week or two to adjust to our home but now that she is, she is showing us her true personality and braveness. She is so low maintenance (in our opinion!) and loves to lounge around and nap. She would do best in a quiet neighborhood with someone who\u2019s home often, or with someone who has access to a private outdoor space \u2014 we're so happy with how much better she has gotten with crate training as she has become acclimated to the home. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a loyal, affectionate companion who just needs a little time and love to blossom, Dolly might be your perfect match. She\u2019s ready to find her person and give them all the love she\u2019s been saving up! \ud83d\udc97\n\n\ufeffDolly is approximately 0y 10m 29d old and may be 43 to 53 pounds when fully grown.

      "description": "If you are excited for puppy kisses and snuggles this holiday season, Dean is your man! At 3 months old, Dean is curious about everything and can turn almost anything into a toy\u2013wicker baskets, the wheel on a Peloton bike, and the tails of the two adult dogs he currently lives with (before proper correction, of course!). Dean loves other dogs and has received significant socialization in his short time as a foster. Always eager to play, Dean is also learning when other dogs have had enough play time. While Dean has not received his full set of vaccinations and therefore cannot walk on the streets, Dean has been romping in his private backyard and is quickly learning how to walk on a leash (which he has also turned into a toy!). \n\nIn his short time with us, Dean has proven to be a quick learner. He is consistently using the pee pads for going to the bathroom and has already mastered basic commands such as \u201csit\u201d (we are currently working on \u201cdown\u201d and \u201cpaw\u201d). Dean is such a love bug and is genuinely the smartest pups we have ever met.\n\n\ufeffDean is approximately 0y 2m 29d old and may be 55 to 67 pounds when fully grown. They are microchipped and up to date on all age-appropriate medical care. Their breed is unknown as we have not had a DNA test done.\n\nAlthough our dogs are listed as unknown breed, buildings with specific dog restrictions typically enforce their rules based on what breeds a dog appears to resemble. It's always important to keep that in mind and know your building's policies before adopting a dog.\n\nThis dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue.

      "description": "Blondie is the sweetest girl you can imagine, and has had a tough road. She just wants to have someone by her side and with her to be close to. Because of her life experiences, it is clear that other dogs and exposure to other dogs are not her favorite thing, and would thrive in a place where she can relax and call her very own. She loves playing little rounds of fetch, loves her little snuffle ball, and loves to cuddle. She has yet to meet a person (adult!) she does not love. She loves her little walks, assuming she doesn't see any other doggies, and just would thrive in a quiet place where she has near constant companionship.\n\n\ufeffBlondie is approximately 12y 6m 23d old and is fully grown at 13 pounds. They are microchipped and up to date on all age-appropriate medical care. Their breed is unknown as we have not had a DNA test done.\n\nAlthough our dogs are listed as unknown breed, buildings with specific dog restrictions typically enforce their rules based on what breeds a dog appears to resemble. It's always important to keep that in mind and know your building's policies before adopting a dog.\n\nThis dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue. If you're interested in adopting, the first thing you should do is begin the registration process at\u00a0www.muddypawsrescue.org. If you are already a registered adopter with Muddy Paws Rescue, please email us at\u00a0adoptionmeetings@muddypawsrescue.org.",

We prepared everyone for the meet and greet and it went so well. \n\nWe let Luke observe from behind the gate in his \u201croom\u201d (not the crate). He got to see how my dogs recognized and reacted to my guest. When he calmed down a bit we leashed him and actually ignored the guest to just walk around the kitchen, get some treats and bring down the energy a few notches. Then the introduction was very short and sweet. Guest stayed still, slowly put hand out for her to sniff, and then Luke walked away.

She loves long walks and exploring her neighborhood (sometimes hard to get her to come back inside, but once she\u2019s in she\u2019s turns into a complete couch potato!). Big fan of belly rubs, a nice long bone to chew for hours or a toy to chase around. She behaves very well on walks, with some light pulling which has improved a ton with her new double leash. She also generally does not get distracted by other dogs or noises on walks (but always on the lookout for squirrels!). A good listener, a best friend and a fun loving spirit. I really can\u2019t say enough good things about this girl. Best of all, she loves the outdoors, whether its rolling around in the grass or just people watching in the park, Coconut could spend her entire day outside.\n\n\ufeffCoconut is approximately 1y 1m 1d old and is fully grown at 70 pounds. They are microchipped and up to date on all age-appropriate medical care. Their breed is unknown as we have not had a DNA test done.\n\nAlthough our dogs are listed as unknown breed, buildings with specific dog restrictions typically enforce their rules based on what breeds a dog appears to resemble. It's always important to keep that in mind and know your building's policies before adopting a dog.\n\nThis dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue. If you're interested in adopting, the first thing you should do is begin the registration process at\u00a0www.muddypawsrescue.org. If you are already a registered adopter with Muddy Paws Rescue, please email us at\u00a0adoptionmeetings@muddypawsrescue.org.",

      "description": "Meet And Peggy, the third Schuyler sister, who blended into the background during her two months at NYC ACC, but in her foster home has turned into a total scene-stealer in the best way. She\u2019s fully housetrained and crate trained, and while she\u2019s a strong girl, she walks nicely on her harness. She loves to play fetch (and monkey in the middle, if you have two willing humans!), and has discovered the joys of the flirt pole, but she balances her energy out with an equal number of hours of couch snuggles. She's tried to play with the resident dogs in the home, but they're all old and stodgy and have declined (which she accepts without putting up a fuss). \n\nIndoors, she\u2019s a top-tier couch snuggler and a gentle giver of kisses to both humans and dogs. She\u2019s food-motivated enough to train well without being overly intense about it. New environments or loud noises may startle her for a moment, but she recovers quickly and looks to her people for guidance.\n\nSee more of (And) Peggy on her foster mom's IG highlight reel @house_of_tan_gang (where she fits RIGHT in!)\n\n\ufeffAnd Peggy is approximately 1y 10m 21d old and is fully grown at 57 pounds. They are microchipped and up to date on all age-appropriate medical care. Their breed is unknown as we have not had a DNA test done.\n\nAlthough our dogs are listed as unknown breed, buildings with specific dog restrictions typically enforce their rules based on what breeds a dog appears to resemble. It's always important to keep that in mind and know your building's policies before adopting a dog.\n\nThis dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue.

Despite her age, Calua still has a lively spirit and a playful energy. She is a pro at fetch and nibbling at her stuffed toys. She loves to follow you around, always wanting to be near, and her favorite thing in the world is a good belly rub, which she happily soaks up with pure joy. Her curious nature means she\u2019s always interested in what\u2019s going on around her, eager to explore and learn, but she does it all with a gentle and loving demeanor. Calua\u2019s combination of spunk, sweetness, and open-heartedness makes her a truly special companion who brings comfort and happiness to everyone she meets.\n\n\ufeffCalua is approximately 9y 1m 6d old and is fully grown at 17 pounds.

      "general_personality": "Ellie is social and outgoing, but learning to control her excitement level will take a little while, since moving to the city is such a huge change. She can get overstimulated and escalate quickly, but not at all out of aggression, so we are working on strategies to help her approach each situation a little slower. At home, it is a polar opposite, as she has decided a specific spot on my couch is the best and prefers to stay there most of the time, napping, or waiting for someone to sit next to her and scratch her belly.",
      "daily_routine": "Ellie is an early riser, redecorating her crate as early as 5 AM. Between 6 and 6:30, she will give some light barking to let me know she wants to come out. She immediately takes her favorite spot on the couch while I make coffee and prepare breakfast for the dogs. We eat breakfast at 7 AM, and then go for a long morning walk. She returns to her post on the couch, occasionally playing with chew toys that I put near her, but mostly organizes the blanket and pillows to make a perfect spot to nap. Sometimes Ellie is somewhat of a Velcro dog, moving from room to room wherever I am, basically changing nap locations. We spend a little time working on training exercises, but only as long as she wants the treats involved. Around 2 PM, we go for a long afternoon walk. We find wide sidewalks that are still relatively busy with people and dogs so she can practice containing her energy. Like my resident dog, she sees every open door as an invitation, and freely introduces herself to everyone.  At 5 PM, the dogs have dinner, and Ellie is very good about eating near my dog, keeping to her own bowl. No signs of food guarding whatsoever. For the rest of the evening, she wants to cuddle. She will tap you with her paw to indicate she wants pets, and will keep doing this every time you stop. At any point if I need to step out, she will easily go into the crate, but her redecorating starts a lot earlier when it\u2019s not overnight sleep time. Last walk is around 10 PM. By 11 PM, Ellie will go into her crate to go to sleep, and will rest until she wakes up at the crack of dawn to rejoin us.",

Shaun is also a sensitive dog: he really does not like yelling, harsh voices, or very loud, chaotic environments. He can be slightly protective of \u201chis\u201d people and space.

Loud noises - like a siren sometimes scare me, but I'm really good with the vacuum and when music is being played. I like to boop their ankles with my nose and to circle around them to keep them in one place. I go for walks in my bag all the time and have been on the subway and in a taxi. Though I haven't met any other dogs, I love to play my foster brother. I love the ball and all my squeaky toys. I love to nap - I'm a really good sleeper. I'm also growing so fast! I'm really smart and already know how to sit, lay down and go to \"place\" which is my bed. I don't cry in the crate unless I'm left for a long time - like over three hours - but I sleep in it at night and will sleep for a solid 6 hours. When I have to go to the bathroom, I use the pad and will cry from the crate. When I'm out of the crate, I know to use the pad, but sometimes I still have accidents. I don't love baths, but I tolerate them and I love to give kisses and snuggle on the couch.\n\n\ufeffPepper is approximately 0y 2m 5d old and may be 23 to 37 pounds when fully grown.

      "description": "Hi there! My name is Hammie. It\u2019s hard to believe I\u2019m brand new both to the city and to the world, being only 2 months old, because I am such a good puppy! I also LOVE listening to the TV, so I\u2019d be thrilled to listen to your favorite show with you. \n\nI love other dogs, and playing with my foster sister dog is my favorite way to spend my time. I want to spend time with my foster family\u2019s cats; unfortunately, I think they\u2019re a puppy like me and want to play with them, and they\u2019re not so much a fan of that. \n\nMy favorite toy is anything I can play tug of war with, but honestly, I love most anything I can fit in my mouth. Some of my toys are even cat toys because I\u2019m so small. I haven\u2019t learned yet to spit out cardboard toys or fluff rather than eating it, so I\u2019m better off with actual dog toys than DIY ones. \n\nI\u2019m a pro at potty pad training, but I\u2019m still working on my enforced naps. My foster parents let me play for about an hour before I go down for a two hour nap, but I like to wake up earlier at an hour or an hour and a half. I\u2019m getting better at it every day! I have a snuggle puppy that plays a heartbeat for me that I like to cuddle with during my naptime; my foster parents give me some kind of fun toy to help keep me occupied if I wake up early. I don\u2019t like sleeping in a quiet room because every noise seems so loud, but I LOVE to sleep to the TV. White noise is only okay, but I love hearing people talk, so TV is perfect. \n\nI also really love going for walks in my puppy sling! Being outside is awesome, and I have some of my best naps while my foster parents are having a coffee walk with me in a sling. I am happiest around my people, and being held or laying on my people is my favorite thing in the world other than playing with my foster sister. I don\u2019t really like being left alone right now, but who would when they\u2019re less than 5 pounds and only 2 months old? I\u2019m just a baby!\n\nI\u2019m brand new to the city and still have lots of learning to do! I am working on the commands \u201csit\u201d and \u201clay down.\u201d I\u2019m an indoor puppy, so I use pads exclusively for potty time. My tummy has been a little unsettled since arriving in the big city, so I\u2019m only eating chicken, rice, and pumpkin right now, but I love food and can\u2019t wait til my stomach lets me have more treat and food options. \n\nMy foster parents tell me every day how cute and small I am, so I must be pretty special. Do I sound like the right fit for your family? Apply to adopt me today at Muddy Paws Rescue.\n\n\ufeffHammie is approximately 0y 2m 16d old and may be 28 to 42 pounds when fully grown.

      "description": "Milk Dud aka Dudley is the stubmuffin low rider squishy meatball of your dreams! Poor Dudley was found wandering the cold NYC streets and brought to the city shelter, where he was very fearful, with irritation around his neck and on his legs. Since coming into a foster home, he instantly blossomed into a joyful, goofy, affectionate dumpling. He flops down head first into your lap for belly rubs, grumbles with joy when pet and kissing your face, lifts one ear only when listening carefully, and happily snoozes most of the day away. He is great in his crate, and will sleep for hours when left alone. If you're looking for the ultimate friendly, low energy, indoor-preferred snuggly couch potato this winter, Dudley is your guy!\n\nDudley arrived to foster recently from his stay at the shelter where he was very fearful, and is working on building his courage walking on the street on leash. He currently does not go on walks on the street, but is comfortable with fosters Brooklyn yard. We are working hard to build his confidence, and he's making progress! He would also do well with a resident dog to show him the ropes.\n\n\ufeffMilk Dud is approximately 3y 0m 29d old and is fully grown at 42 pounds. They are microchipped and up to date on all age-appropriate medical care. Their breed is unknown as we have not had a DNA test done.\n\nAlthough our dogs are listed as unknown breed, buildings with specific dog restrictions typically enforce their rules based on what breeds a dog appears to resemble. It's always important to keep that in mind and know your building's policies before adopting a dog.\n\nThis dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue. If you're interested in adopting, the first thing you should do is begin the registration process at\u00a0www.muddypawsrescue.org. If you are already a registered adopter with Muddy Paws Rescue, please email us at\u00a0adoptionmeetings@muddypawsrescue.org.",

Butternut loves to go for walks & would love an active family, but she's just as happy curling up on the couch & burying her head into you when she comes inside while you rub her belly. She loves people and is always smiling with her tongue out! She's very curious when on walks and loves to sniff. If a door is open, she wants to go inside to check it out. She has mostly been ignoring other dogs but occasionally wants to say hello. I think she'd do well with another dog in the house or being an only dog (she IS a Princess after all). She really enjoys her treats and her toys. Butternut is the sweetest, most polite pup. She will sit and \"ask\" to come up on the couch before jumping up and politely sits in the elevator when going outside. She will make you laugh and give you lots of cuddles and makes everyone she meets smile!\n\n\ufeffButternut is approximately 5y 2m 6d old, approximately 66 pounds, and we estimate their optimal weight to be about 45 pounds. They are microchipped and up to date on all age-appropriate medical care. Their breed is unknown as we have not had a DNA test done.\n\nAlthough our dogs are listed as unknown breed, buildings with specific dog restrictions typically enforce their rules based on what breeds a dog appears to resemble. It's always important to keep that in mind and know your building's policies before adopting a dog.\n\nThis dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue.
